Where Do Billionaires Keep Their Money?,Business,/news/8-places-billionaires-keep-money-130030395.html,"where do billionaires keep their moneyBillionaires have been able to not only acquire wealth but most have gradually built it over time. This means that many have had successful investments, which makes it natural for everyone else to wonder where they are investing or keeping their money in order to see that growth. We’ve compiled a list of some of the most common investments that billionaires make when looking for sustained growth of their money over time.Keep in mind, though, that billionaires don’t typically manage their own money and instead choose to work with a financial advisor to help with their asset allocation.1. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents are common places where billionaires keep of some their money. Though not often thought of as an investment, cash is a liquid asset, meaning you can use it in a variety of ways as needs or desires arise. In a crisis, having cash on hand gives you the flexibility to respond. That’s why billionaires keep a significant portion of their money in cash and cash equivalents.However, with current rates of inflation, cash has less of an emphasis. Inflation causes the value of money to drop, so having too much of it on hand during an inflationary period can mean you lose significantly. 2. CommoditiesCommodities are often another piece of a billionaire’s portfolio, and having such assets can help hedge against risk, inflation and volatility. For instance, in a scenario where inflation is causing difficulty for the rest of the market, having investments in raw materials whose price is rising can help protect you if other parts of your portfolio are suffering. People and economies depend on commodities, and inflation makes them worth more money.Raw materials and agricultural products – like precious metals, industrial metals like copper, oil and natural gas, coffee, corn, pork bellies and soy beans – are popular types of commodities held and traded by billionaires or their agents. 3. Foreign CurrenciesHolding foreign currencies offers billionaires the potential to capitalize on fluctuations of value in various currencies. It is simply a form of diversification: Rather than have all their assets denominated in one currency, they spread some of their wealth to assets denominated in other currencies. That offers protection against one currency falling and capital appreciation if another currency in which they have assets gains value.Story continues4. Securities Another common place where billionaires keep their money is in securities. Securities are financial investments and instruments with some value that can be traded, oftentimes on public markets. Common types of securities include bonds, stocks and funds (mutual and exchange-traded).Funds and stocks are the bread-and-butter of investment portfolios. Billionaires use these investments to ensure their money grows steadily. Billionaires typically hold onto these investments, instead of trying to time the market for a quick buck. That means they’re relying on the long-term upward growth of the market to give them a return. 5. Private Equity and Hedge Fundswhere do billionaires keep their moneyPrivate equity and hedge funds sit adjacent to securities and trading markets. While they aren’t the same thing, these two types of investment tools are popular among billionaires. They appeal to people of high net worth who can afford large investments and higher risk. Such people are sometimes categorized as sophisticated investors or accredited investors.Hedge funds use large pools of money and strategic investments in a variety of assets to generate high returns. Private equity, on the other hand, trades in privately owned businesses with the goal of running the business for higher profits. Both require a significant amount of money to participate, keeping them from being an option for many investors.6. Real EstateIt should come as no surprise that one place billionaires keep their money is in real estate. One of the most common ways to invest in real estate without worrying about constant maintenance is to put your money into real estate investment trusts (REITs). This can provide you with a strong return while someone else manages the investments and management of the physical properties. Commercial, industrial and residential property investments can also offer a steady stream of income from tenants. Of course, owning real estate is great when its value is growing, but what about other reasons? Another advantage of owning real estate is taxes. For instance, if your property depreciates, it’s deductible from your taxes.7. CollectiblesWhen billionaires are looking for places beyond traditional investments to keep their money, they might turn to tangible, collectible investments.  These often include pricey collectible items, like vintage cars, fine art and rare or antique musical instruments and original manuscripts of famous books. While all successful investing requires research, it’s especially true for collectibles. The investor needs both an interest in the items, but also a discerning eye and the ability to not become immediately emotionally invested.8. CryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies – like Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum – are volatile and intimidating to many, including billionaires, but some billionaires have chosen to invest in them. The truth is digital currencies are growing in legitimacy and value. Cryptocurrency – and the blockchain it’s built on – is a revolutionary technology that could change many industries.Part of the appeal of crypto for billionaires is that it allows for a secure store of value. Due to cryptography, the money can’t be taxed, stolen or confiscated. It’s also apolitical and free of government oversight. Plus, it can be used globally without worrying about shifting exchange rates.Of course, cryptocurrencies are still unpredictable and have yet to gain widespread use. That keeps some billionaires from investing, but others see crypto as another opportunity to grow their wealth, or at least protect it from taxation. These currencies also make it easy to move money or pay for things in other countries.The Bottom Linewhere do billionaires keep their moneyYou may not be a billionaire, but you can still see how they make their money work for them. By learning where billionaires keep their money, you can pursue some of these investment types yourself in order to grow your own wealth. Cash stored in savings and investments in a diverse portfolio of securities and commodities is a good starting place,  but the more wealth you acquire the more you can invest in more aggressive opportunities. Tips on Investing Like a BillionaireBillionaires didn’t become rich without help, so there’s no reason you should struggle alone.

Elon Musk Warns Against Margin Debt on Risk of Market ‘Mass Panic’,Business,/news/elon-musk-warns-against-margin-215641054.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Elon Musk is warning against something he himself has done — borrowing against the value of securities one owns — because of the risk of “mass panic” in the stock market.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk Warns Against Margin Debt on Risk of Market ‘Mass Panic’Power Outages, Flight Delays as US Storm Leaves Trail of ChaosChina Estimates Covid Surge Is Infecting 37 Million People a DayEastern US Power Grid Orders Cuts Amid System-Wide EmergencyAlameda’s Former CEO Ellison Said She, Bankman-Fried Misled FTX Lenders“I would really advise people not to have margin debt in a volatile stock market and you know, from a cash standpoint, keep powder dry,” Musk said in the All-In podcast released Friday. “You can get some pretty extreme things happening in a down market.”The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer put up billions of his own money when he purchased Twitter Inc. for $44 billion earlier this year and saddled the company with $13 billion of debt. Bloomberg News has reported that Musk’s bankers are considering replacing some of the high-interest debt he layered on Twitter with new margin loans backed by Tesla stock that he’d be personally responsible for re-paying.Tesla Margin-Loan Talks Show Pressure Mounting on Musk, BankersHe’s also disposed of nearly $40 billion of Tesla’s shares, a move that contributed to driving the stock to a two-year low. Following the latest sales, Musk again said this week he will stop selling shares, adding that the pause could last for two years or so.The warning, at least the second made by Musk this month, is ironic given the billionaire has previously pledged his Tesla shares. As of December 2020, Musk had 92 million Tesla shares pledged as collateral, according to an SEC filing in April 2022.During the podcast, Musk also reiterated his belief that the economy is overdue for a recession and that the slowdown could be similar to the scale seen in 2009.“My best guess is that we have stormy times for a year to a year and a half, and then, dawn breaks roughly in Q2 2024, that’s my best guess,” Musk said. “Booms don’t last forever, but neither do recessions.”Story continues--With assistance from Susanne Barton and Craig Trudell.(Updates with previous disclosures on Musk’s pledged shares)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Chatbots Are Coming for GoogleApple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion GiftDrugmakers Are Testing Ways to Stop Alzheimer’s Before It StartsThe Two-Word Mantra That Changed Bank of America’s Risk CultureThe Federal Reserve Doesn’t Care About Your Misery©2022 Bloomberg L.P."

Bill Gates Hit By Housing Market Swoon? Billionaire Reportedly Lists Daughter's Apartment At Discount,Business,/news/bill-gates-hit-housing-market-192520787.html,"More evidence for the housing market downturn came this week, as a slew of housing market readings came in worse than expected. Now, there appears to be anecdotal evidence to confirm the same.What Happened: Bill Gates has listed for sale the three-bedroom New York City apartment that he bought for his daughter Jennifer in 2018, the New York Post reported.The twist in the tale is that the asking price is $4.75 million, a discount from the $5 million at which it was purchased.The condominium, which is at 1212 Fifth Avenue, was bought by Gates so that his daughter could use it after graduating from Stanford University. Jennifer has since then married fellow equestrian Nayel Nassar and both are set to welcome their first child in a few weeks.Toni Haber, one of Manhattan’s most experienced real estate advisors working with Compass, is holding the listing. The 2,389 square feet corner condo offers direct Central Park views to the west and north and has had substantial upgrades and configurations, the listing showed.See also: Best Real Estate StocksWhy It’s Important:  Home sales and prices have been on a downward trajectory in the U.S., portending a housing market collapse. Existing home sales fell for a 10th straight month in November, a report from the National Association of Realtors showed this week.Sales fell 7.7% month-over-month and 35.4% year-over-year. A Commerce Department report showed a 15.3% annual drop in November new home sales, although the metric increased 5.8% from the previous month.Higher mortgage rates and home prices served as a drag on the housing sector for much of this year. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose 4% through the first ten months of the year, one of the largest on record, Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network said, citing data from Zillow. Home prices, however, have begun to head southward in recent months.Story continuesGates’ decision to sell the condo could have stemmed from the fact that Jennifer no longer uses it and he desires to give away much of his wealth to charity, the Post said.Read next: Economist Says Housing Turnover Will Drop To Its Lowest Rate In 40 YearsPhoto via Wikimedia CommonsSee more from BenzingaNio Day 2022: New EC7 Coupe, Improved ES8 Flagship SUV, 3rd-Gen Power-Swap Station And MoreTesla Said To Push Forward Production Suspension At Giga Shanghai As China's COVID Cases SurgeDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

'Not the time to get greedy': Home flippers getting burned by the housing market downturn are now slashing prices to cut losses — here are the 2 big reasons why,Business,/news/not-time-greedy-home-flippers-110000999.html,"'Not the time to get greedy': Home flippers getting burned by the housing market downturn are now slashing prices to cut losses — here are the 2 big reasons whyHome flippers who pounced on recent drops in home prices now face some major hurdles — and potentially major losses.It’s a story few could have foreseen: After home-flipping reached record heights as 2022 kicked off, the bubble seems to have burst. The 1-in-10 home flipping/conventional sales ratio has dropped as the overall real estate market hits the brakes.Home sales fell for the ninth month in a row in October, and dipped an astounding 28.4% from October 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. It’s now causing many property investors to dump their inventory, and fast.“Anybody that’s flipping right now needs to be looking closely at pricing of property: Price it to sell. Today is not the time to get greedy,” Noah Brocious, president of Capital Fund I, a hard-money lender that does business in Phoenix, Colorado and Texas, told Bloomberg News in the fall.It’s true that elsewhere — in the stock market, for example — low prices and selloffs reveal golden opportunities to buy. But for those eagerly eyeing the housing market, it’s time to think again.Don't missAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindBetter than NFTs: You don't have to be ultra-rich to own a piece of a Pablo Picasso. Here's how to enter the fine art markeYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Slumping demandHome flippers must face facts: The skyrocketing demand we saw earlier this year may not return for years, if ever. First, housing inventory reached a 10-year low back in January 2022, according to Trading Economics, with just 860,000 single family and condo units for sale in the United States.About 115,000 single-family homes and condos were “flipped” in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2022, according to real estate data curator ATTOM. This made up about 8.2% of all home sales in the quarter, or up to one in 12 transactions. It indicated that any economic cooldown had not yet manifested in the broader market.Story continues“The total number of properties flipped was the second-highest total we’ve recorded in the past 22 years, and the median sales price of a flipped property — $328,000 — was the highest ever,” said Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence for ATTOM.Read more: The 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)“The big question is whether the fix-and-flip market will begin to lose steam as overall home sales have declined dramatically over the past few months, and the cost of financing has virtually doubled over the past year.”Inventory of homes for sale peaked in July at 1.31 million homes. While that came down to 1.22 million homes in October, a general rise has continued even as demand continues to fall.Rising ratesNow for the second issue facing home flippers, the one that’s making everyone groan: higher interest rates. That means costlier mortgages, which have socked flippers with massive increases in their loans.As property investors usually invest in several homes at once, it’s no wonder that many now want to get them off their hands. But with prospective buyers also turned off by high rates, it’s turning into a Hail Mary play.The federal funds rate rose 0.5% at the start of 2022, and now sits between 4.25% and 4.50%. And it may climb higher in the new year as the Fed has hinted at the possibility of more hikes to come, which could tip the country into a recession.With that in mind, many property investors will want to wait before they get greedy over home prices. Today, a great deal on a home is counterbalanced by a mortgage with a far higher interest rate compared to this time last year.There is some hope on the horizon, though, according to the ATTOM report. After six straight periods of losses, profit margins rose during the latest quarter. The gross profit on a typical transaction hit $73,700, up 10% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter.What’s next, then? Americans should have more information on forward-looking trends when the next housing reports come out at the end of the month.Meanwhile, bear this in mind: As home flipping tends to mirror the rest of the market, property investors should brace for further drops — stomach drops included.A better way to buy property?Of course, flipping single-family homes and condos isn't the only way to invest in real estate.Amid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, real estate moguls are still finding ways to effectively invest their millions.Prime commercial real estate, for example, has outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors.

Oil Passes Natural Gas as Main Fuel for Power Plants in New England,World,/news/oil-passes-natural-gas-main-231311044.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil took over from natural gas as the leading fuel for power plants in New England, a significant switch that signals how the grid is desperately trying to keep the lights on in the face of a winter massive storm.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk Warns Against Margin Debt on Risk of Market ‘Mass Panic’Power Outages, Flight Delays as US Storm Leaves Trail of ChaosChina Estimates Covid Surge Is Infecting 37 Million People a DayEastern US Power Grid Orders Cuts Amid System-Wide EmergencyAlameda’s Former CEO Ellison Said She, Bankman-Fried Misled FTX LendersThe six-state grid relied on oil for at least a third of its power generation and for as much as 40% at times on Saturday, ISO New England data show. Natural gas provided as little as 15% by mid-afternoon.The region typically only uses oil to meet demand on the hottest and coldest days of the year as back up. Heading into the peak evening hours, New England issued a series of grid alerts warning of a possible shortfall of power reserves and asked market members to voluntarily conserve electricity.The operator later said it’s trying to buy emergency supplies from market participants or neighboring regions. The situation is so tight that prices jumped to more than the $2,000 a megawatt-hour price cap on Saturday evening. This time last week, spot power was in the $30 range.While New England was always likely to be operating on tight supplies this winter, the fact that oil overtook gas, nuclear and hydro — typically the cheapest and biggest sources of power on this grid — shows a level of severity perhaps expected later in the season.Dirty OilThe storm is already stoking up a debate about the energy transition: how to ensure there are enough power plants online to meet heating needs in extreme conditions. And when an operator resorts to a fossil fuel as dirty as oil to stave off outages, that adds another level of tension to the debate.On the 13-state Eastern US grid operated by PJM Interconnection, gas was king but supply constraints also contributed to an unexpectedly large number of outages that prompted warnings of rotating blackouts.Story continuesFossil fuels gained share on other grids. After the wind died down in Texas on Friday, gas accounted for 73% of power generation that night with coal making up the bulk of the rest. Coal also gained share in the Central US grid operated by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator.--With assistance from Brian Eckhouse.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Chatbots Are Coming for GoogleApple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion GiftDrugmakers Are Testing Ways to Stop Alzheimer’s Before It StartsThe Two-Word Mantra That Changed Bank of America’s Risk CultureThe Federal Reserve Doesn’t Care About Your Misery©2022 Bloomberg L.P."

The latest GDP report did show that the U.S. economy rebounded by 2.6% in Q3 after declining for Q1 and Q2 of this yearDespite this, experts are saying there is a 70% chance the U.S. will go into recession in 2023, according to a December Bloomberg survey.Personal finance expert Suze Orman joined the chorus during a September episode of her Women & Money podcast, predicting a recession at ""the beginning of 2023.""She recently sat down with Moneywise to talk about the risks of not being prepared for a financial emergency.On the positive side, Orman has suggestions for proactive ways to prepare for a recession in the new year.WATCH NOW: Full 30-minute Q&A with Suze Orman and Devin Miller of SecureSave on the importance of emergency savings accountsDon’t missBetter than NFTs: You don't have to be ultra-rich to own a piece of a Pablo Picasso.

According to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in November.Moreover, the unemployment rate is holding steady at 3.7%.But Orman warns against complacency.“If there is a recession, you better believe the same firms that are hiring now, will be looking to reduce their payroll,” she writes. “I think the best gift you can give yourself right now is to imagine you are laid off.”In December 1969, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was an equally low 3.5%, yet an 11-month recession followed right afterward.When you are laid off, paychecks stop coming in. So Orman highly recommends building an emergency savings fund before your next crisis hits.Story continuesBut a lot of people don't think about saving until after something happens — like losing yur job.""For 40 years, I've tried to change the mindset of people,"" Orman said in a recent interview with Moneywise.""Usually, people have to hit rock bottom, before they make a change.""So how many months of financial cushion do you need?Orman suggests having enough savings to help you cover your expenses for a year. If that seems like a far-fetched target, just focus on saving as much as possible — one month at a time.Eliminate your credit card debtCredit cards are a great invention — for companies that offer you credit cards.For those that have an unpaid balance on their credit cards, debt could balloon dramatically during a recession.The reason? High interest rates.Read more: The 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)The average credit card interest rate in America today is 22.91%, according to Lendingtree. At that rate, the compounding factor can make any unpaid credit card balance grow to dangerous levels very quickly.Orman notes that carrying credit card debt right now is “asking for so much trouble” as interest rates are on the rise.She’s not the only expert who believes you should get rid of credit card debt altogether.Legendary investor Warren Buffett has also warned about the danger of carrying an unpaid credit card balance.“If I owed any money at 18%, the first thing I’d do with any money I had would be to pay it off,” Buffett said in 2020. “You can’t go through life borrowing money at those rates and be better off.”Don’t spend it allIn an economy where the unemployment rate is low and wages expected to increase by 4.6% next year, it would be easy to assume that people are piling money into their savings.But that’s not the case.According to a recent report from LendingClub, 6 in 10 Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.Inflation is one reason why people are having trouble saving – nearly everything has gotten more expensive.In a recent interview with Moneywise, Orman stressed the importance of having an emergency fund set aside.“It is not improbable that come April of next year that the Fed funds rate could be very close to 5%, which means interest rates on credit cards could be way up there,” says Orman.By spending less than you earn, you can build up your emergency savings faster. And by getting used to a more frugal lifestyle, you can lower your living costs — so the same financial cushion can last longer in the event that you lose your job.WATCH NOW: Suze Orman tells a cautionary tale on what happens when you can't cover your next financial emergencyWhat to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Here are 3 easy money moves to give your bank account a boost todayMillions of Americans are in massive debt in the face of rising rates.

Here are 3 easy ways to buck that dangerous downtrendWhen Americans were receiving stimulus checks from the government during the early days of the pandemic, they were able to save quite a bit of money.But things have changed.According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the personal savings of Americans sits at $520 billion as of November 2022, marking a substantial drop from the $4.85 trillion in 2020.Savings are now below even pre-pandemic levels and with the national stockpile shrinking by $100 billion since October.Here’s the blunt reality: Persistent inflation continues to deplete savings.

So to boost your savings, you can either increase your income or lower your expenses.In this economic climate, it’s probably a good idea to hold off on purchasing big-ticket items that you don’t necessarily need. In fact, that’s exactly what Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos recommends.“If you're an individual considering purchasing a big-screen TV, you might want to wait, hold onto your money, and see what transpires,” Bezos tells CNN. “The same is true with a new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever else.”Story continuesThere are also ways to lower expenses that you can’t avoid.If you are paying too much for your car insurance policy, for example, you can compare car insurance and save up to $500 a year.The same goes for home insurance.While premiums are on the rise, comparing multiple home insurance companies is an easy way to find substantial savings.Boosting your incomeSwitching jobs may seem daunting.But data from Pew Research suggests that 60% of people who switched jobs or employers between 2021 and 2022 saw their income increase. Meanwhile, fewer than half of people who stayed at their jobs saw any wage growth.So if you’re looking to build up some savings, leaving your current role or employer for better opportunities may be your best bet at getting the salary increase you’re hoping for.Read more: The 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)If you don’t want to switch jobs, consider getting a side hustle — something you get paid for doing in addition to your full-time job. It allows you to earn extra income — and could even be a way of testing the entrepreneurial waters.There’s no need to start big.A simple side gig like tutoring could be worth $75-$90 an hour, while dog walking could net you as much as $1,000 a month.Putting spare change to workWhen it comes to building a financial safety net, you don’t need large sums of money. In fact, you can start with some nickels and dimes.A survey from MyBankTracker found that 55.5% of Americans don’t do anything with their spare change. They just let it sit.

How to Have a Comfortable Retirement by 62,Lifestyle,/news/retire-comfortably-62-211118636.html,"The key to retiring at 62 is to assess your current assets, estimate future income and preferred lifestyle, including whether you’re willing to work part-time, and how you’ll pay for healthcare until Medicare kicks in. While 65 is the traditional age to retire and start getting Social Security payments, many Americans want retire earlier, if possible. A financial advisor can help you put a financial plan together for retirement, regardless of what age you want to do it by.What to Consider When Retiring at 62If you're set on retiring at age 62, there are a few important questions to ask yourself first. Here are some of the most important things to weigh in the balance:How much money you'll need to cover your monthly expensesHow much income you can expect from a 401(k), individual retirement account, pension, taxable investments and cash savingsWhat kind of lifestyle you'd like to have in retirementWhether you'll continue working on a part-time basis or start a side hustle or businessHow you'll pay for medical expenses until you become eligible for MedicareYour overall health and anticipated life expectancyWhat you have for long-term care and life insurance coverageWhether you're interested in leaving a financial legacy for children, other loved ones or a charityThe goal is to get a sense of how financially prepared you are to retire at age 62 and whether your plan is achievable, based on how much you'll have saved and what you expect to need.Anticipating Healthcare NeedsFor many seniors, healthcare is one of the largest expenses you'll contend with. If you're retiring at age 62, it's important to keep in mind that you can't get Medicare until age 65. That leaves a three-year gap in which you'll have to either purchase health insurance, which means paying premiums, or pay out of pocket.Assuming you stay healthy or you have a lot of savings in a health savings account (which offers tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses), that might not be too concerning. But if you have a chronic health issue or your spouse does, medical bills could quickly eat into your savings.Story continuesPlanning Retirement WithdrawalsAnother important question to ask when planning how to retire at 62 is how much of your investment portfolio you can draw from each year. A rule of thumb for retirement withdrawals is the 4% rule. This rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement investments annually, adjusting each year for inflation, to fund a 30-year retirement.Let's assume you're interested in how to retire at 62 with $500,000 saved and you expect to live 30 years in retirement. If you follow the 4% rule, you'd have to cap your annual withdrawals at $20,000 to avoid running out of money. That comes out to just under $1,700 per month. To make that number work, you may have to do some significant reshuffling of your budget and lifestyle. Of course, that number doesn't include what you might get from Social Security.Something else to keep in mind is in which order it makes the most sense to tap retirement assets. Generally, you're better off starting with taxable brokerage accounts first before moving on to tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) or traditional IRA, leaving tax-free Roth accounts last so those can continue growing and accumulating interest. By minimizing taxes as much as possible, you can keep more of your retirement income.Social Security Benefits and Retiring at Age 62If you're considering retiring at 62, it's likely that Social Security is one of your primary concerns. That's because 62 is the first year you're eligible to receive Social Security benefits, but your benefit will be lower than if you'd waited longer to start receiving those benefits.Normally, you'd need to reach your full retirement age, which for most people is 66 or 67, to qualify for the full monthly benefit amount. And to get the largest possible benefit you'd need to wait until age 70. Taking benefits at age 62, or at any time between 62 and your full retirement age would reduce your benefit amount.The amount of the reduction depends on the year you were born. For example, if you were born in 1960 or later, taking Social Security benefits at age 62 would reduce your monthly benefit by 30%. If you're married and spousal benefits are also being paid, those benefits would be reduced by 35%. So for example, if you're anticipating a $1,000 monthly Social Security payment and your spouse is expecting $500, your benefits would be reduced to $700 and $325, respectively. This Social Security calculator can tell you what you can expect to receive, based on your age and when you begin taking benefits.Going from $1,500 per month in expected benefits to $1,025 could put a squeeze on your retirement budget if you have fewer assets to fall back on. For example, if you didn't save as much in your employer's 401(k) as you would have liked or you only had an IRA to fund, then your nest egg might be on the smaller side. That could make it harder to stretch a reduced Social Security benefit.Should You Delay Social Security Instead?The flip side of the Social Security coin is that waiting to take benefits can work in your favor. You can delay taking benefits up until age 70, which would then allow you to claim 132% of your full monthly benefit amount. The table below calculates the monthly increase rate by birth year:Delayed Retirement IncreaseBirth Years12-Month Increase RateMonthly Increase Rate1933 to 19345.5%11/24 of 1%1935 to 19366%1/2 of 1%1937 to 19386.5%13/24 of 1%1939 to 19407%7/12 of 1%1941 to 19427.5%5/8 of 1%1943 and later8%2/3 of 1%As you can see above, you can enjoy a nice income boost in retirement, but that scenario assumes that you won't need those benefits for some time. It's also a bet that you'll live long enough that the higher benefit offsets the years you went without Social Security checks. But, on the other hand, if you're set on retiring at 62, you'll need to be sure you have enough money to cover your expenses so that delaying Social Security works for you, not against you.You could, for example, take on a part-time job or start a business to make extra money. But whether you want to do this or not may depend on the kind of lifestyle you're hoping to have in retirement. If you're ready to spend time indulging in neglected hobbies or simply relaxing, then continuing to work in some form may not be high on your priority list.It's also important to understand how earning income in retirement can impact your Social Security benefits. If you have reached full retirement age (66 or 67) your benefits will not be penalized regardless of how much you earn. However, your benefits could be reduced if you haven't reached full retirement age and you earn more than a certain amount. In 2022, your benefits will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn above $19,560. Your benefits will be reduced by $1 for every $3 you earn above $51,960 (assuming you reach your full retirement age in 2022).If you're married, you and your spouse might consider splitting the difference on Social Security. For example, one of you could take benefits at age 62 while the other waits until full retirement age or even delays benefits to age 70. Running all the numbers can help you decide which may work best for stretching your retirement dollars.Bottom LineThere's no secret formula for retiring at 62 and living a comfortable lifestyle. It all comes down to saving consistently and planning thoroughly beforehand to ensure that you'll have enough money. Social Security is just one part of the picture, but it's an important one.Weighing the pros and cons of taking Social Security at age 62 can help you decide if it's the right move. You also need to draw up a retirement budget, something you can use this free calculator to do.Tips for InvestingConsider talking to a financial advisor about whether you’re financially prepared to retire at age 62. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

TipRanks ‘Perfect 10’ List: These 2 Stock Giants Look Compelling at Current Levels,Business,/news/tipranks-perfect-10-list-2-093000355.html,"Recognizing the right stocks is a skill that every investor needs to learn, and the sheer volume of market data, on the main indexes, on individual stocks, on and from stock analysts, can present an intimidating barrier. Fortunately, there are tools to help. The Smart Score is a data collection and collation tool from TipRanks, using an AI-powered algorithm to sort the data on every stock according to a series of factors, 8 in all, that are known for their strong correlation with future share outperformance.That all sounds like a mouthful, but it boils down to this: a sophisticated data tool that gives you a simple score, on a 1 to 10 scale, to judge the prospects of any given stock. It puts the complex world of stock market data at your fingertips.The Perfect 10, of course, should be a brilliant neon sign post guiding investors in for a closer look – and sometimes, it guides investors toward stocks that have never lacked for headline or notice. These are some of the market’s giants, stocks that are household names, feature trillion-dollar market caps, and boast Strong Buy consensus ratings from the Street’s best professional analysts. So, let’s give two of them a closer look.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)First up on our list is Microsoft, one of the best-known brand names in the world – and also the second-largest publicly traded company in the world, with a market cap of $1.78 trillion. Microsoft got its start back in the mid-70s, and was part of the initial expansion of the personal computer tech revolution. The company rose to prominence when its Windows operating system became the industry standard, still used today, for the majority of all personal computing.Today, the company is adapting successfully to the growing cloud computing environment, offering products such as Office 365, which brings the Office applications for home, school, and small business use onto the cloud; Dynamics 365, which does the same for business applications; and the Azure platform to support cloud computing operations. At the same time, the company maintains service and support for its more modern Windows operating systems.Story continuesIn the last reported quarter, Q1 of fiscal year 2023 (September quarter), Microsoft reported $50.1 billion at the top line. This translated to a 10% increase year-over-year, and beat the $49.6 billion forecast. The solid result came on the back of a 24% reported increase in cloud revenue, to $25.7 billion, or slightly more than half of the total.On the negative side, the company reported a y/y drop in net income, by 14% to $17.6 billion, with the diluted EPS falling 13% to $2.35 per share. The real hit for investors came from the company’s fiscal Q2 guidance, which was set at $52.35 billion to $53.35 billion, or up  2% at the midpoint. This was, however, below the $56.05 billion analysts had wanted to see – and the stock fell after the earnings release.Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss, however, remains bullish on the company's prospects. The 5-star analyst writes, “While investors worry forward numbers have not been de-risked, we see a strong (and durable) demand signal in the commercial businesses, which should lead to improving revenue and EPS growth in 2H23…. The strength of Microsoft's positioning across key secular growth segments remains unchanged. Mix shift toward faster growing Azure and Dynamics 365 and relatively durable Office 365 growth (in constant currency) help support management's goal of 20% constant currency growth across its Commercial businesses.”In Weiss’s view, Microsoft’s potential fully merits its Overweight (Buy) rating, and his $307 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 29%. (To watch Weiss’s track record, click here)Overall, Microsoft stock has picked up 27 recent ratings from Wall Street’s analysts, a total that includes 25 Buys against just 2 Holds – for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $238.73, and their average target of $291.34 suggests a 22% gain on the one-year time horizon. (See MSFT stock analysis on TipRanks)Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL)Next up is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, that everyone knows. The world’s largest search engine is part of an overall firm that boasts a $1.16 trillion market cap, making it the third largest publicly traded firm, after Microsoft and Apple. Alphabet isn’t just Google; the company also owns the Android OS, the popular YouTube website, and is even moving into the autonomous vehicle niche through its Waymo subsidiary.While Alphabet remains near the top of the global tech industry, the recent 3Q22 showed some cracks that will need to be addressed. For the most part, these are related to general economic conditions, particularly shrinking advertising budgets in the online industry. The company’s Q3 results showed total revenues of $69.09 billion, up 6% year-over-year – but that modest growth represents a distinct deceleration from the prior year’s 41% growth rate, and it missed the $70.5 billion forecast. Operating margins also fell, from 32% one year ago to 25% in the last quarter; operating income was down 18% to $17.13 billion.The miss in revenue was exacerbated by a large miss in YouTube’s top line. Advertising revenue on the video site came in at $7.07 billion, missing the $7.42 billion forecast by a 4.7% margin.While there are serious headwinds facing Alphabet/Google, we should not underestimate the company’s clear strengths. Google remains the internet’s premier search engine, and Google Search accounted for more than $39.5 billion of the total revenue. And, despite the pullback in overall online advertising, Google Ads saw revenue’s absolute numbers grow by $1.3 billion y/y, to $54.4 billion (a total that includes Google Search’s gain, as well as the pullback in YouTube advertising). Finally, the company boasts deep pockets, with over $21.9 billion in cash assets on hand. In short, Alphabet has both the market position and the resources to weather a storm.Mark Mahaney, 5-star analyst with Evercore ISI, is cognizant of GOOGL’s difficulties in the online ad segment going forward. Yet, while he predicts short term pain he also sees longer term gain: “For now, we estimate GOOGL’s organic revenue growth deteriorating further to 6% Y/Y in Q4, before beginning to recover sometime in ‘23. But after the Macro and the FX and the Comps, we strongly believe GOOGL will re-emerge as the broadest, strongest global ad revenue platform, with a dramatically profitable business model, notable diversification into Cloud Computing, and substantial long-term option value with Waymo.”Quantifying his stance on GOOGL, Mahaney rates it as Outperform (a Buy) for the year ahead and backed by a $120 price target that implies a 34% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Mahaney’s track record, click here)All of Mahaney's colleagues agree with his thesis. GOOGL shares score a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 29 recent positive analyst reviews. The stock’s average price target, $125.76, indicates potential for 41% growth from the current trading price of $89.23 over the coming year.

But is getting a degree going the way of bell bottoms, cable television and calling someone on the phone?With a strong economy and an excess of jobs with few workers to take them, big companies like Google, IBM and Delta Air Lines have eased up on educational requirements in an effort to find hires based on skills and experience instead.With a four-year degree perhaps seemingly not as crucial for Americans climbing the career ladder as it once was — young people might be rethinking the need for higher education as well.“It's a bit [like] musical chairs right now,” says Alicia Modestino, an associate professor and labor economist at Northeastern University. “We're seeing a lot of people shift jobs, move up in the labor market. That’s great.”However, she warns that with the Fed raising interest rates in an effort to quell inflation, Americans need to be prepared for the job market to slow in the coming months.“Pretty soon the music's going to stop — so you want to have someplace to land that's going to be good for the long term.”Don't missBetter than NFTs: You don't have to be ultra-rich to own a piece of a Pablo Picasso. Here's how to enter the fine art market'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindEmployers responding to tight labor marketThe tech industry in particular has been struggling with a talent shortage since pre-pandemic times.Google and 150 other companies use the tech giant’s online college-alternative program to train and hire entry-level workers, reports The Wall Street Journal. And according to CNBC, IBM doesn’t ask for a bachelor’s degree for half of its U.S. roles.Bank of America also doesn’t request college degrees for most of its entry-level jobs, while Delta says degrees for pilot applicants are “preferred” but not required.Story continuesAnd applicants for thousands of government jobs in the state of Maryland no longer need a bachelor’s degree — instead, they can submit any relevant work experience, military training or other educational certificates.This shift arrives during a thriving labor market with low unemployment and high job vacancies. And although there’s been talk of that coming to an end, the Labor Department’s latest jobs report indicated that hiring slowed only slightly in November, with 263,000 jobs added last month, compared to 284,000 jobs in October.Modestino adds there’s precedent for this approach. During the Great Recession, employers responded by focusing on skill requirements in addition to educational requirements since there were more college-educated workers available to them.It may not be an actual ‘culture shift’So should parents stop putting cash away for their kids’ college tuition? Modestino is “pessimistic” about whether big employers relaxing their educational credential requirements is truly part of a “culture shift.”And with recent shifts in the economy, she has concerns about the future of work.“Looking at where we are in terms of the business cycle and what the Fed’s doing with interest rates, [there’s] the potential for us to overshoot and tip into a recession,” Modestino warns.Read more: The 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)The Fed raised its federal funds rate for the seventh time this year and more hikes are expected to arrive in 2023. Experts like Modestino worry this could trigger a recession, which would mean a slowdown in hiring and potential job and salary cuts.Modestino advised her own son — who has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice — that he needs to capitalize on the hot job market and get on a career path.“We don't know if it’s going to be a soft landing in the labor market in the next six months,” she says. “So I would certainly urge any young people … that now's the time to make those decisions. Because I do worry that the window’s closing on those opportunities.”She anticipates that when workers are plentiful again and employers have many applications to sift through, many companies will “revert back to the lowest common denominator” when they’re hiring — a four-year college degree.So, is getting a bachelor’s degree actually worth it?Parents may have long encouraged their kids to pursue higher education, but Modestino points out that there are many jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree. And so making that big decision about whether to go to college should depend more on the young person’s career goals.For example, you don’t need a bachelor’s degree to become a phlebotomist, but it’ll likely require a certification in phlebotomy. On the other hand, a PhD is necessary to become a tenured college professor.That said, having more credentials can look good on a resume and open doors for inexperienced workers — especially when job opportunities aren’t as abundant and employers can afford to be choosy.In a recession or weaker labor market, having an academic credential to your name can often have a “sheepskin effect,” Modestino says — an economic phenomenon where employers pay higher wages to workers with degrees.A study from Georgetown University found that bachelor’s degree holders earn 31% more than those with an associate’s degree and 84% more than someone with a high school diploma. But higher education doesn’t always equate to higher earnings.“When you're in a labor market like this, we've seen wages actually rising faster at the bottom because they're so desperate for talent. And so [employers are] actually trying to hire on talent and reward on talent, rather than just a credential,” explains Modestino.But keep in mind that students pay a price for that extra earning potential. With about 43 million borrowers in the U.S. who owe over $1.6 trillion in student debt, getting a degree isn’t always worth the financial burden. Parents pushing their kids to get higher education just for the sake of it might want to have a bigger conversation about whose interests they’re prioritizing.“There's been this message for at least the last two decades that college is the only pathway,” says Modestino.“That's been a disservice, I think, to some young people who would have been better off going to a vocational technical school or taking a different pathway through workforce training and development.”What to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Here are 3 easy money moves to give your bank account a boost todayRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead.

401(k) Plan Participants Say They Need to Save This Much to Retire,Business,/news/401-k-plan-participants-save-130058167.html,"A couple looks over their retirement savings. A recent survey found that Americans believe they need $1.9 million saved by retirement.If $1 million was once the consensus target for retirement savings in the U.S., that appears to be changing. A recent Schwab Retirement Plan Services survey found that 401(k) plan participants across the country now believe they must save $1.9 million for retirement. The online survey, handled by Logica Research, conducted 1,000 interviews with plan participants between ages 21 and 70 and gauged confidence levels for achieving their own retirement goals. Whether you’re just beginning to save or quickly approaching retirement age, a financial advisor can help you build a plan.Retirement Survey ResultsIn 2019, the same Schwab survey found that 401(k) participants had a target retirement savings of $1.7 million. That goal has since increased and so has investors’ confidence in reaching their goals. More than half (53%) of survey participants said they are likely to achieve their retirement goals, up 16% from a year ago when the COVID-19 pandemic unleashed massive economic turmoil and uncertainty.“We experienced tremendous stress in our work and home lives this past year that highlighted the importance of financial wellness and the value of trusted advice,” Catherine Golladay, head of Schwab Workplace Financial Services, said in a statement.But 401(k) plan participants say they still face numerous challenges. In fact, 61% said they needed the type of professional advice a financial advisor can provide, including help calculating a retirement savings goal, investing, creating income in retirement and planning for taxes in retirement.How to Save $1.9M for RetirementA recent study found that 401(k) participants believe they need $1.9 million saved for retirement.While the prospect of having $1.9 saved by retirement seems daunting, saving early and often will increase your chances of reaching this goal. Tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and 403(b)s, which are offered through employers, can help you build a nest egg over the years. While annual contributions to these types of plans are capped at $19,500 in 2021 (with a $6,500 catch-up permitted for people 50 and older), those saving for retirement can also contribute $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re over 50) to an individual retirement account (IRA) each year. Those saving for retirement may also want to explore whether a mega backdoor Roth IRA is appropriate for them.Story continuesEvery three years, the Federal Reserve examines the changes in U.S. family finances, including how much people have saved in retirement accounts at various points in their lives. Using data from the Federal Reserve’s 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College calculated the median retirement savings across several age groups:Median 401(k)/IRA balance for ages 35-44: $51,000Median 401(k)/IRA balance for ages 45-54: $90,000Median 401(k)/IRA balance for ages 55-64: $120,000Here’s how much someone with the median 401(k)/IRA balance at age 35, 45 and 55 would have to save in total each month to reach the $1.9 million threshold by age 65 (these projections assume an 8% annual rate of return):Building a $1.9 Million Nest Egg Age 401(k)/IRA Balance Monthly Savings Retirement Savings at Age 65 35 $51,000 $900 $1,899,046 45 $90,000 $2,475 $1,901,238 55 $120,000 $8,930 $1,900,065A 35-year-old who has already saved $51,000 for retirement is clearly in the best position and would have to sock away $900 per month over the next 30 years to nearly reach the $1.9 million threshold. Older workers would have to save much more each month. A 45-year-old with $90,000 saved must sock away $2,475 per month to eclipse the $1.9 million mark by age 65. Meanwhile, a 55-year-old with $120,000 saved would have to play some serious catch-up and save nearly $9,000 per month to reach their goal within 10 years.Bottom LineA recent study found that 401(k) plan participants believe they'll need $1.9 million in retirement savings.A million bucks isn’t what it used to be. It was once thought a retirement savings milestone, but 401(k) plan participants now believe they’ll need nearly twice as much, according to a Schwab Workplace Financial Services survey. Building up a nest egg that large will likely take time and planning, highlighting the importance of saving for retirement in one’s 20s and 30s.Retirement Saving TipsSmartAsset has a variety of tools that can help you plan for retirement.

What the Fed’s December rate hike means for homebuyers and sellers,Business,/news/fed-december-rate-hike-means-180200472.html,"This article was originally published on Bankrate.com.The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates for the seventh consecutive time this year. This time, though, the hike is smaller: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced a half-point increase in the federal funds rate Dec. 14, which is down from the three-quarter-point increases of the past several meetings. Still, the last time it raised rates by as much in a single year was in the 1980s.In an effort to rein in raging inflation, the Fed boosted interest rates by a quarter-point in March 2022, then by a half-point in May. It raised them even more in June, by three-quarters of a percentage point — which was, at the time, the largest Fed rate hike since 1994 — and went on to do the same in July, September and November.The hikes are designed to cool an economy that was on fire after rebounding from the coronavirus recession of 2020. That dramatic recovery has included a red-hot housing market characterized by record-high home prices and microscopic levels of inventory.However, since late summer the housing market has shown signs of cooling, with appreciation slowing nationally and prices even dropping in many markets. And home prices are driven not just by interest rates but by a complicated mix of factors — so it’s hard to predict exactly how the Fed’s efforts will affect the housing market.“The housing recession is here,” says Marty Green, principal at mortgage law firm Polunsky Beitel Green. “The big question now is how quickly it spreads to the rest of the economy.”Higher rates are challenging for both homebuyers, who have to cope with steeper monthly payments, and sellers, who experience less demand and/or lower offers for their homes.“The cumulative effect of this sharp rise in rates has cooled the housing market and caused the economy to start slowing, but hasn’t done much to lower inflation,” says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst.How the Fed affects mortgage ratesThe Federal Reserve does not set mortgage rates, and the central bank’s decisions don’t move mortgages as directly as they do other products, such as savings accounts and CD rates. Instead, mortgage rates tend to move in lockstep with 10-year Treasury yields.Story continuesStill, the Fed’s behavior sets the overall tone for mortgage rates. Mortgage lenders and investors closely watch the central bank, and the mortgage market’s attempts to interpret the Fed’s actions affect how much you pay for your home loan.The December rate hike was the seventh bump in 2022, a year that saw mortgage rates swing wildly from 3.4 percent in January all the way to 7.12 percent in October before inching back down again. “Such increases diminish purchase affordability, making it even harder for lower-income and first-time buyers to purchase a home,” says Clare Losey, assistant research economist at the Texas Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&M University.How much do mortgage rates affect housing demand?There’s no doubt that record-low mortgage rates helped fuel the housing boom of 2020 and 2021. Some think it was the single most important factor in pushing the residential real estate market into overdrive.Now that rates have surged higher than they’ve been in two decades, how will that affect home sales and prices? “Mortgage rates [have] caused refinance activity to effectively stop and home purchase activity to slow markedly,” says Mike Fratantoni, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. Not only have sales slowed, but economists expect price declines of anywhere from a few percentage points to more than 20 percent.Yet, in the long term, home prices and home sales tend to be resilient to rising mortgage rates, housing economists say. That’s because individual life events that prompt a home purchase — the birth of a child, marriage, a job change — don’t always correspond conveniently with mortgage rate cycles.History bears this out. In the 1980s, mortgage rates soared as high as 18 percent, yet Americans still bought homes. In the 1990s, rates of 8 percent to 9 percent were common, and Americans continued snapping up homes. During the housing bubble of 2004 to 2007, mortgage rates were higher than they are today — and prices soared.So the current slowdown may be more of an overheated market’s return to normalcy rather than the signal of an incipient crash. “The combination of elevated mortgage rates and steep home-price growth over the past few years has greatly reduced affordability,” says Fratantoni. “The volatility seen in mortgage rates should subside once inflation begins to slow and the peak rate for this hiking cycle comes into view.”For now, though, the housing market remains difficult for buyers.“The housing sector is the most sensitive to and experiences the most immediate impacts from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy changes,” says NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The softness in home sales reflects this year’s escalating mortgage rates.”Yun says the average monthly mortgage payment has jumped 28 percent over the past year, a bit of sticker shock that’s bound to reverberate through the housing economy. “I expect the pace of price appreciation to slow as demand cools and as supply improves somewhat due to more home construction,” he says.In fact, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) says the housing squeeze is already easing as demand declines. The inventory of homes for sale rose to a 3.3-month supply in October, compared to a record-low 1.6-month supply in January.Next steps for borrowersHere are some tips for dealing with the climate of rising interest rates:Shop around for a mortgage. Savvy shopping can help you find a better-than-average rate. With the refinance boom slowing, lenders are eager for your business. “Conducting an online search can save thousands of dollars by finding lenders offering a lower rate and more competitive fees,” McBride says.Be cautious about ARMs. Adjustable-rate mortgages are growing more tempting, but McBride says borrowers should steer clear. “Don’t fall into the trap of using an adjustable-rate mortgage as a crutch of affordability,” McBride says. “There is little in the way of up-front savings, an average of just one-half percentage point for the first five years, but the risk of higher rates in future years looms large. New adjustable mortgage products are structured to change every six months rather than every 12 months, which had previously been the norm.”Consider a HELOC. While mortgage refinancing is on the wane, many homeowners are turning to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) for tapping home equity.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand"

"4 Times Advisors Should Use Custom Indexing, According to Vanguard",Business,/news/4-times-advisors-custom-indexing-202603307.html,"Direct indexing is a hot strategy for financial advisors looking to differentiate themselves to potential clients – but what is it and when does it make sense for clients?The idea behind indexing, of course, isn’t new. Vanguard Group founder John Bogle created the world’s first index mutual fund in 1975 when he launched the Vanguard 500 fund, which did nothing more than track the stocks listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Instead of a complex scenario in which fund managers picking individual stocks, the index was simple for investors to understand, provided broad-based exposure to U.S. equities and was cheap to run, resulting in lower fees.As of 2021, there were 7,481 mutual funds in the U.S. – and that total was a drop from 2020. But despite a plethora of indexes fund managers could follow, funds were still aiming to cover a broad mix of stocks. The advantage of custom indexing – also called direct indexing or personalized indexing – eschews the one-size-fits-all approach to create an index designed to meet a the goals of a single investor. Custom indexing can be a great way investors to content with a challenging market and will be increasingly popular, as O’Shaughnessy predicts that by 2025 most financial advisors will have software to manage custom indexes.For more assistance working custom indexing into your financial plan, consider working with a financial advisor.What Is Custom Indexing?A custom index is set up as a separately managed account for an investor that directly purchases individual stocks. Those selections are based on an existing index, then adjusted and tweaked using sophisticated software to match the needs, circumstances and priorities of the individual account-holder. These accounts carry higher fees, of course, and are best suited for high net-worth individuals with substantial portfolios who can benefit from a range of customized options, particularly in four scenarios.Tax-loss harvesting: Even when a given index is up some of its individual stocks are trading at a loss. Because the investor in a custom index holds individual stocks, it’s possible to sell off those shares that are down, creating a tax loss that can be used to offset the taxes due on the overall gain of the index. Another advantage is being able to separate long-term and short-term losses and gains within the index.Story continuesESG investing: Socially conscious investors concerned about the environmental, social, and governance polices and standards of the companies that make up their holdings. Unlike investing in a standard index, a custom index can be designed to avoid shares of firms involved with fossil fuels or weapons, for example, to include firms that promote diversity and inclusion, or to bypass companies with particular political ties or a history of illegal behavior.Factor investing: Investing in companies with specific characteristics – “factors” – such as value, rapid-growth or in highly specialized market segments is difficult to achieve with a standard mutual fund or ETF. With virtually any individual stock available, a custom index can be tailored to meet those criteria.Diversification: Standard indexes built around growth, value or some other factor can end up overly concentrated in certain sectors, such as technology. In addition, a senior executive may be required to hold a significant number of shares in his employer. A healthcare CEO, for example, can create a custom index.Bottom LineCustom indexing entails creating a separately managed account for an investor that directly purchases individual stocks. This technique is growing in popularity among financial advisors who have the software to personalize this strategy to meet the needs of the investor.Tips on InvestingInvesting, whether in custom indexing or buying individual stocks, can be complex. Sometimes it helps to have an expert at your disposal. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with financial advisors in your area in five minutes.

How to Invest in Rivian,Business,/news/invest-rivian-200758173.html,"How to Invest in RivianRivian is an American electric vehicle manufacturer. Founded in 2009, this firm isn’t one of the big car companies that have dominated the market for years. Nevertheless, it is considered one of the main rivals to Tesla. Instead, this newcomer is hoping to take advantage of the EV transition to break into the personal vehicle market and help reshape it for good. Here’s what you need to know as an investor. Whether you invest in established companies or want to buy a stake in a newer corporation, take advantage of the insights and guidance of a financial advisor.Rivian’s Business ModelRivian is an electric vehicle company that focuses on truck-style products. For the consumer market, the company builds pickup truck style and sports utility style vehicles. For the business market, the company builds delivery vans and an interchangeable “skateboard” chassis that allows for modifications based on the needs of an individual business.Rivian also plans to open and operate a network of charging stations for electric vehicles across Canada and the United States. In 2021 the company launched three models. Keys to its vehicles feature bluetooth wireless and near field communication technologies. At time of writing, its market capitalization was about $34 billion.How to Invest in RivianHow to Invest in RivianYou can directly invest in Rivian. This company, which is backed by Amazon, went public in November 2021. It is a common stock listed as Rivian Automotive, Inc. on the NASDAQ market. Its ticker symbol is RIVN, and at time of writing it traded for approximately $43. If you would like to invest in this stock, you can do so directly through any brokerage that trades public shares. This can involve:Working with a broker directlyIf you trade stocks through a third-party broker, you can contact and instruct them to buy shares of Rivian on your behalf.Working through an online brokerIf you trade stocks through an online broker, such as E*TRADE, you can buy shares of Rivian on your own behalf. Log on to your portfolio account and search for the RIVN stock. You will then be able to directly buy shares of Rivian.Story continuesRisks and OpportunitiesRivian’s main opportunity and risk are the same: It is attempting to break into an established industry with a brand-new technology. While there are risks and reward to breaking into an established industry, the biggest issue with Rivian is that it is a new technology firm. Electric vehicles are still an evolving industry. While this technology has progressed to a certain level of consumer adoption, it hasn’t completely arrived yet. Issues like distance driving, charging times, charging access and expense continue to raise problems with widespread EV adoption.Most notably the ideal user class for current electric vehicles is urban drivers, as these are consumers who need their cars for shorter bursts that more readily accommodate the range of an electric vehicle. Yet this is also the consumer class most likely to live in an apartment, and therefore not have access to an overnight charging station for their vehicle. By contrast, suburban and rural consumers are more likely to own their own homes and so be able to build a station in their driveway or garage for overnight charging. Yet this is also the category of consumer most likely to need their car for the kind of long trips for which EVs are still not well suited.Engineers are confident that car companies can and will solve these problems, but the question of who and how remains open.The Bottom LineHow to Invest in RivianRivian is an electric vehicle company that focuses on trucks and truck-style vehicles. It was founded in 2009 and went public in late 2021. Shares are available on the NASDAQ exchange under RIVN. Rivian will likely do quite well if it can stay technologically ahead in this competitive industry. It will likely struggle if it cannot. The volatility of the company’s stock, which has swung between highs over $170 and lows around $50, reflects this uncertainty.Tips on InvestingElectric vehicles are getting huge, with many car companies pledging partial or total overhauls to their fleets. Yet refueling remains arguably the biggest obstacle to widespread adoption. It still can take between 15 and 30 minutes to recharge an electric vehicle, far too long for a stop at the gas station. That’s a problem in many places, but not all.Investing in any individual company is a gamble, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea. Consider working with a financial advisor as you assess electric vehicle company shares. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

Second Mortgage vs. Home Equity Loan: Which Is Better?,Business,/news/second-mortgage-vs-home-equity-175304510.html,"Second Mortgage vs. Home Equity Loan: Which Is Better?Owning a home can yield valuable benefits, including the opportunity to accumulate equity in the property. Equity is the difference between what you owe on the home and its fair market value. There are different ways you can tap into this equity, including taking out a second mortgage. But is there a difference between a second mortgage and a home equity loan? Making wise use of the equity you’ve built up in your home is best done in consultation with an experienced financial advisor.What Is a Second Mortgage?A second mortgage is any mortgage loan that’s subordinate to a first mortgage. Typically, a first mortgage is a loan that’s used to purchase the home. First mortgages are usually larger than second mortgages.The home serves as collateral for a second mortgage. Like a first mortgage, the loan must be repaid over time with interest. So if you have a first mortgage and a second mortgage, you’ll have two monthly mortgage payments.If you default on either mortgage loan, the first mortgage lender takes priority over the second mortgage lender for repayment. This means that if the home falls into foreclosure, the first lender would get paid before the second and it’s possible the second might receive little to nothing at all.Second mortgages tend to have higher interest rates than first mortgages for that reason. A borrower who now has two mortgage payments to make instead of one presents a greater risk for the lender. So they compensate by charging more in interest to offset the possibility of the borrower defaulting.What Is a Home Equity Loan?A home equity loan is a loan that allows you to borrow against your home’s value. In simpler terms, it’s a second mortgage.When you take out a home equity loan, you’re withdrawing equity value from the home. Typically, lenders allow you to borrow 80% of the home’s value, less what you owe on the mortgage. Some lenders may increase this to 85%.Here’s an example of how home equity loans work. Say your home is worth $575,000 and you owe $350,000. The most you’d be able to borrow against the equity using the 80% rule is $110,000.Story continuesHere’s what the math looks like:$575,000 x .80 = $460,000$460,000 – $350,000 = $110,000The proceeds from a home equity loan are paid out to you in a lump sum and you can use it however you like. Common uses for home equity loans include:Home improvements or repairsDebt consolidationLarge purchasesWedding expensesVacation expensesMedical expensesEducation expensesBusiness expensesThe loan has to be paid back with interest and depending on the loan terms, repayment may last anywhere from five to 30 years.Second Mortgage vs. Home Equity LoanWhen you’re talking about second mortgages vs. home equity loans, you’re really talking about the same thing. A home equity loan is a second mortgage on a home that’s secured by the underlying property. So there’s no “which is better?” question to answer as they’re referencing the same thing.Second Mortgage vs. Home Equity Loan: Which Is Better?The better question to ask is “Should I get a home equity loan?” There are some pros and cons associated with having a second mortgage on your home.On the pro side, the main benefit of a second mortgage is being able to access your home’s equity. A home equity loan offers flexibility, in that you can use the money for just about anything. So you could overhaul your kitchen, for example, if you want to make some upgrades that will improve your home’s value. Or you could use the money to consolidate and pay off high-interest credit card debt.Home equity loan interest rates are often much lower than credit card interest rates or even personal loan rates for borrowers who have good credit scores. Opting for the shortest loan term possible can help you pay off a home equity loan faster, though keep in mind this will mean a larger monthly payment.The interest on a home equity loan may be tax-deductible if you’re using the proceeds to buy, build or substantially improve the property that secures it. So again, if you’re renovating your kitchen to increase the home’s value or replacing your HVAC system, you could write off the interest. The IRS does have strict rules about this so you may want to talk to your tax professional or financial advisor about what is and isn’t allowed.The biggest drawback associated with having a home equity loan as a second mortgage is that it’s secured by the home. This means if you run into trouble making payments on the loan, you could be at greater risk for default and eventually, foreclosure. Not only would you lose the home but you’d be out of all of the money you’ve invested into it over the years.Home Equity Loan vs. HELOCA home equity line of credit or HELOC is another type of second mortgage loan. Like a home equity loan, it’s secured by the property but there are some differences in how the two work.A HELOC is a line of credit that you can draw against as needed for a set period of time, typically up to 10 years. After the draw period is over, you’d enter the repayment period, which may last as long as 20 years. At this stage, you’d pay back the amounts you drew from the line of credit with interest.HELOCs can have variable interest rates while home equity loans more often have fixed interest rates. The amount you can borrow may be higher compared to a home equity loan. For example, lenders may use a 90% equity limit in determining HELOC amounts. Both home equity loans and HELOCs can have upfront fees.Home Equity Loan vs. HELOCSecond Mortgage vs. Home Equity Loan: Which Is Better?What’s better, a home equity loan or HELOC? The answer depends on what you need to tap into your equity for. For example, say you want to make some major home improvements but you aren’t exactly sure how much money you’ll need. You might choose a HELOC since you’ll have a flexible line of credit you can use as needed. The HELOC has a variable rate but you’re hoping rates will stay low over time.On the other hand, say you know you need exactly $50,000 to fund your home updates. You might prefer a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate instead, as this can offer more predictability in terms of payments and overall cost. The downside here is that if you go over $50,000 for your project you may need to use another loan or a credit card to finish the project.Using a home equity loan calculator or HELOC calculator can help you estimate how much you might be able to borrow and what kind of rates you’ll likely qualify for. Keep in mind that as with first mortgages, qualification for a second mortgage can depend on your credit scores, income and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.The Bottom LineWhether you call it a second mortgage or a home equity loan, it means the same thing. Withdrawing from your equity can put cash in your hand when you need money but consider what the cost will be and how having two mortgages might affect your monthly budget.Mortgage Planning TipsConsider talking to a financial advisor about the pros and cons of taking out a second mortgage and whether it might be right for you. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.

"Crypto Is Down Bad, But VCs Keep Pouring Money In",Business,/news/crypto-down-bad-vcs-keep-141629450.html,"zk humor columnGiven the contagion and chaos we have witnessed since Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX had a sudden multibillion-dollar coronary, you may be tempted to conclude the entire crypto industry is headed for the great Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the sky, and that nobody in their right mind could possibly still have faith in it. And yet, even in the frigid cold of Crypto Winter, venture capital continues to pour in for certain lucky builders. Analysts at Pitchbook report that crypto VC investment in 2022 (a brutal year across all tech) has outweighed that of both fintech and biotech, pulling in $6.5 billion over the last 12 months, $879 million of it in the last quarter. Just take a look at the last week or so of drab crypto industry press releases. You’ll see a $4.75 million round for a thing called Earn Alliance. A $70 million raise for a thing called Ramp Network. A further $15 million for Roboto Games, $3.1 million for NFT game Burn Ghost, and a vertiginous $72 million for market maker Keyrock. There are even giddy plans for a $2 billion metaverse fund by Animoca Brands, while crypto derivatives exchange Matrixport, led by former Bitcoin mining kingpin Jihan Wu, is gunning for a $100 million raise—at a valuation of $1.5 billion. It’s easy to understand why venture capital firms continue to take these risks. VCs are like sharks—they have to keep swimming by investing in crap (sorry, “decentralized technologies”) or they’ll die, even in a bear market. But why do they continue to put their riches into stuff that keeps failing?Everywhere you look, the industry appears to be in full tail-spin. Just last month, Multicoin Capital, Kyle Samani’s previously high-flying and exuberant firm, had its assets frozen due to exposure to FTX. Some of the biggest funders in the space, like Babel Finance, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX’s own venture arm, caused some of the biggest explosions. Star-studded companies like Blockstream, meanwhile, are writing their valuations down by orders of magnitude, and the $1.5 billion valuation sought by Matrixport looks positively modest compared to the $32 billion valuation once commanded by its now-deceased competitor. Story continuesAll of this has caused an obvious chilling effect. Every VC firm and project I spoke to says they are being far more cautious than before with regard to investments. A Coinbase spokesperson noted carefully that funding has “tightened.” Animoca Brands CEO Yat Siu, meanwhile, told me cryptically that “some deals may not make as much sense as they did a few months ago due to market circumstances or changes in valuations.” Ramp Network business lead Paulina Joskow told me that she has heard of a number of projects failing to meet raising requirements, along with a number of deals falling through at the last minute. Many projects, she added, don’t look forward to anything bigger than a Series B before the VC taps shut off.  Kevin de Patoul, the CEO of the market maker Keyrock, said he has noticed a fresh emphasis on “due diligence”—utterly unremarkable in most other industries, but something of a groundbreaking shift in crypto. But eight-figure raises and sky-high valuations are still out there, much of it coming from the usual suspects. These are the well-capitalized firms that know when to cash out and how to manage risk. Their ranks include pedigreed industry participants like Ripple, Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm, Polychain Capital, Pantera, and the elephant in the room, Andreessen Horowitz. They are joined by firms from the Web3 sector, such as Animoca Brands, which is raising that optimistic $2 billion metaverse fund. (There are also a few obscure specialists like the VC firm “gumi Cryptos Capital,” Argonautic Ventures” and “Harrison Metal.”)Presumably the main way these companies stayed afloat was simply by not being exposed to FTX. Paradigm, which did invest in the exchange, managed to stay away from FTX’s FTT shitcoin.  (Whether that was a result of virtuosic investment acumen or  luck is up for debate.) But experience counts, too. Animoca’s Siu told me his company learned a lot from enduring “the much colder and more forbidding environments” of the 2017-2019 bear market. Does that mean “crypto native” VCs stand a better chance than firms cultivated in the comparatively sane financial world? Don’t forget, after all, that FTX’s biggest funders weren’t Animoca or eGirl Capital, but legacy titans Tiger Global, Sequoia and Softbank. Were those non-crypto-native names too easily impressed by SBF’s song and dance? It is also interesting to see where the post-bubble money is going without all that hype behind it. Many of the VC firms and portfolio projects I spoke with since the crash emphasized a conspicuous and renewed focus on “decentralized” investments. Chris Perkins, of the VC firm Coinfund, said the multiple calamities of 2022 only confirmed his long-standing wariness of overly centralized crypto companies. He attributes his company’s continued survival to having avoided those projects. “As we started watching centralized entities fall apart, it—and I’m not saying we desired it—but it further fueled our thesis that we need to stay focused on decentralized technologies,” Perkins told me. Following the crash, he went so far as to actively prune his portfolio of a number of centralized investments. (Though he phrased that obliquely: “We took many thoughtful actions to mitigate counterparty risk.”)It is true that a number of the projects getting funding are critical “infrastructure” projects. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin lending protocol Finterest raised $1.5 million, for instance, while Fleek, which hosts digital content in a decentralized way, raised $25 million. And there are a host of other decentralized projects that have raised money post-FTX crisis, though not all tame and uncontroversial: many indeed support infrastructure for things like high-stakes, decentralized derivatives trading. The thinking is that decentralized tech is more transparent and less liable to the kind of financial chicanery that brought down FTX. (DeFi degens have shouted since the FTX collapse, “This is why you shouldn’t put your crypto on centralized exchanges!”) But wasn’t Terra, the algorithmic stablecoin that got buy-in from Coinbase and Galaxy, sort of decentralized? And isn’t even a polycule, technically, also kinda decentralized? Kinda? It is important to remember that “decentralization” exists along a very long and convoluted spectrum—it is never absolute, and it never confers absolute trust. In some cases it just allows you to observe in real-time as the fraud takes place and “transparently” drains your life savings. So it’s worth asking: Is the latest peer-to-peer Marxism token reaping VC money really “decentralized,” or do its three developers just run each new board proposal through a weird and experimental governance mechanism that’s only legal in Estonia? Note that almost all of the “decentralized” companies I reached out to had their own in-house PR. Would a mempool send out a canned PR quote? Neither is the purported shift to decentralization an overwhelming trend, and there are still signs of the old tendency toward crypto esoterica. A company called Dogami peddling adoptable dogs from outer space just raised $7 million, having apparently demonstrated a 200,000 strong user-base. and a blockchain game based on the popular 80s football manga series ""Captain Tsubasa"" has raised $15 million. These projects are not obvious safe bets by any normal standard. They in fact sound very 2017 ICO era. But VCs still believe in crypto.In an interview with reviled outlet The Block, Dogami’s founder stressed that VCs did a “lot” of due diligence before coughing up the cash. Siu of Animoca, which was involved in an earlier Dogami raise, told me that “no matter how kooky, esoteric and perhaps even whimsical” a project may be, “you need content in order to drive demand.” He  added: “‘Build it and they will come’ is a difficult strategy when there is no demand. You need to have both so they can feed off each other.”Or maybe it’s that old-school, 2000s-era tech silliness that these particular projects embody, allowing them to keep their toes in the gaudy and more credibly profitable Web2 world. Burn Ghost, which raised $3.1 million and develops casual games featuring optional NFT prizes, has “a lot of flexibility on how and where we find our players, and is not solely dependent on crypto market conditions,” its founder and CEO, Steve Curran, told me. Of course, nobody is claiming companies like Burn Ghost and Finterest will be unicorns within the hour. Crypto’s VC manic period is certainly on the wane, perhaps never to truly recover. But it’s still surprising how much cash, even in these very dark times, there is to go around. "

"Crypto is like the ‘World of Warcraft’ economy and legitimizing it with regulations would hurt the financial system, says economist",World,/news/crypto-world-warcraft-economy-legitimizing-204617827.html,"In the wake the FTX collapse, calls to regulate crypto have increased among U.S. lawmakers. But doing so would confer legitimacy to the crypto industry, a prominent economist argued this week, and that in turn could lead to more widespread economic damage.Stephen Cecchetti, an economist and professor at Brandeis International Business School, pointed to the economy within World of Warcraft, an online video game with millions of players.""The strongest argument, I think, against regulation is about conferring legitimacy,"" he said at a crypto debate hosted by the Brookings Institution.""I think of a lot of this stuff as being like a video game, and so if I look at an analog, the World of Warcraft has 120 million players, and it has an economy inside of it,” he continued. “Fortunately, no federal financial regulator has responsibility for overseeing the World of Warcraft. And while there's money involved, I don't think any of us would call on them to supervise online massive multiplayer games. Like the World of Warcraft, crypto, in my view, does nothing to support the real economy, so legitimizing it is simply going to drain creative resources from productive activities.""Crypto regulationsCreating regulations specifically for crypto, he argued, would affect how banks approach the sector.“Legitimizing crypto is going to encourage banks to purchase crypto assets directly and to lend against them as collateral,” he said. “Imagine where we would be if leveraged financial intermediaries had been holding crypto in November of 2021 before the plunge in value.”Cryptocurrencies have fallen dramatically in value since late last year. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has shed more than 60% of its value this year.If “virtually all of the transactions in the crypto world remain inside of the crypto world without links to the real economy,"" Cecchetti said, then it “would be as if this stuff was going on on Mars, and it would leave the traditional financial system unaffected. That should be our goal.”Story continuesAs for the misbehavior in the industry—the “defining feature of the crypto world,” in his view—prosecutors can address it by “enforcing existing laws aggressively, and, where appropriate, going after the celebrities that are promoting this stuff,” he said.FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been charged with eight criminal counts, including two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy related to securities and commodities fraud, money laundering, and violations of campaign finance laws.'Let crypto burn'Calls for greater regulation have gained steam in recent weeks following FTX's epic collapse.Last weekend, Sen. Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate banking committee, called for more regulation, and left open the possibility of banning crypto, though he acknowledged it would be “very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work.”In a statement following the arrest of Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas, Brown said, “Things that look and behave like securities, commodities, or banking products need to be regulated and supervised by the responsible agencies who serve consumers…Crypto doesn’t get a free pass because it’s bright and shiny.”Cecchetti believes a good approach would be to “let crypto burn,” as he and Kim Schoenholtz, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business, wrote in a recent Financial Times column.“In the aftermath of the collapse of FTX, authorities should resist the urge to create a parallel legal and regulatory framework for the crypto industry,” they wrote. “It is far better to do nothing, and just let crypto burn.”Actively intervening, they added, would “provide an official seal of approval to a system that currently poses no threat to financial stability and would lead to calls for public bailouts when crypto inevitably erupts again.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand"

Retirement Basics: Thrift Savings vs. 401(k) Plans,Business,/news/thrift-savings-plans-vs-401-210020862.html,"Thrift savings plans (TSPs) and 401(k) accounts are two vehicles used to save and invest for retirement. Both operate similarly in many ways, including tax advantages, caps on contributions and requirements for minimum withdrawals in retirement. However, TSPs are only available to federal government employees, while 401(k) plans are only available to employees of private-sector companies. Beyond that, TSPs and 401(k)s have some other differences including availability, costs and matching contributions. Consider working with a financial advisor as you create a retirement savings plan.Retirement Plan BasicsTax advantages are a key feature of both TSPs and 401(k)s. Employees can contribute part of their paychecks pre-tax, giving them a deduction in the current year. This allows them to grow account balances without paying taxes. They also have the potential opportunity to withdraw funds at lower tax rates in retirement.Post-tax varieties of both TSP and 401(k) plans let savers pay taxes on contributions now in exchange for the chance to withdraw them and any earnings later at lower tax rates. The post-tax versions of these plans are called Roth 401(k) plans and Roth TSPs.Both TSP and 401(k) plans have annual limits on contributions. The IRS adjusts these limits upward every couple of years. For 2021, the limit is $19,500 for most contributors. In 2022, that limit jumps to $20,500.The plans also share similarities when it comes to withdrawals. Beginning at age 70.5, both TSP and 401(k) plan savers have to start taking required minimum distributions and paying any taxes due.Beyond these similarities, there are differences, such as with vesting. Some private-sector 401(k) plans vest employees with 100% ownership of employer contributions immediately. Others may take up to six years. TSP employer matches are vested immediately, and the automatic employer contributions are vested in two to three years. The employees’ contributions are vested immediately with both types of plans.Story continuesTSP Pros and ConsThe major limitation of TSPs is that participants must be employees of the U.S. federal government. This includes part-time and full-time employees of the civilian branches, as well as military service members. One of the pluses of TSPs is the very low fee structure. TSP annual fees are typically about 0.05% of the money in the account.On the downside, TSP plans offer limited investment choices. Participants can direct their money toward any of 10 funds, including four target-date funds and six that invest in sectors ranging from government bonds to international equities.One of the major pluses of TSPs is that federal employees are automatically enrolled in the plan. They don’t have to choose an option to participate, although they still must choose how much of their pay to contribute.Even if employees don’t choose to contribute money deducted from their paychecks, the federal employer automatically puts an amount equal to 1% of each employee’s pay into the account. These contributions aren’t deducted from employee pay.In addition, the employer will match employee contributions up to 5% of the employee’s salary. This amount is higher than most private-sector 401(k) plans, some of which don’t match employee contributions at all.TSP funds can be moved to an IRA or similar retirement plan if the employee has one. Similarly, funds can be moved from an IRA or other plan to the TSP.401(k) Pros and ConsSince most people don’t work for the federal government, the fact that 401(k)s are open to private-sector employees is a major benefit. As a significant limitation, however, not all employers offer 401(k) plans. Employees whose employers don’t offer 401(k) plans can’t have them. Also, while 401(k) plans are tightly regulated and most plans are similar, employers can make significant decisions about how their plans are implemented. This means that, unlike the TSP, which is open to all federal employees, 401(k) plans can differ widely in their features. Some are better than others.For instance, employees are not automatically enrolled in all 401(k) plans. It’s up to the employer whether the 401(k) will have automatic enrollment, and most choose not to make enrollment automatic. Without automatic enrollment, many employees who could benefit from the plans do not participate.Also, not all employers match employee contributions. Those that do generally match less than the 5% that is standard for TSP participants. And there is no automatic 1% employer contribution with a 401(k).One of the benefits of many 401(k) plans, especially for retirement savers who want more control of their investment portfolios, is the opportunity to choose from a wider section of investments. While a typical 401(k) will have a similarly limited number of investment choices as the TSP, consisting of a handful of mutual funds, some will allow participants much greater latitude, even including the ability to purchase individual stocks and bonds.Finally, 401(k) plans generally have significantly higher fees than the TSP. Private sector 401(k) plans charge administrative fees on top of the fees charged by mutual fund companies. These can run as high as 1.5%, which is enough to have a significant impact on a fund balance over time.Bottom LineTSPs and 401(k) plans are alike in giving employees tax advantages over other approaches to saving for retirement. For federal employees, TSPs’ automatic contributions, higher employer matches and low fees probably make them a superior choice. For people who don’t work for the federal government, 401(k) plans are still a good choice for retirement savings and can be central parts of individual financial strategies.Tips on Estate PlanningSelecting the type of retirement account that is best for you is an important but challenging part of estate planning.

Declining mortgage rates offer some buyers a sliver of hope as they face the 'insurmountable wall' of still-high prices and surging interest rates,Business,/news/declining-mortgage-rates-offer-buyers-140000218.html,"Declining mortgage rates offer some buyers a sliver of hope as they face the 'insurmountable wall' of still-high prices and surging interest ratesAs winter sets in, temperatures are dropping — and so are mortgage rates. But even with that cooling effect, rates remain more than double last year’s.And it’s causing buyers and sellers alike to hesitate before pulling the trigger on a move.“Today’s mortgage rates are keeping homebuyers and sellers in a defensive stance,” says George Ratiu, manager of economic research at Realtor.com.Ratiu notes that the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is $2,000 — a whopping 64% jump from a year ago.“First-time homebuyers are struggling with high consumer prices, property values and interest rates, which are pushing savings rates to very low levels and delaying their ability to gather a sufficient down payment,” he says.“At the same time, current homeowners looking for their next home are finding that the prospect of higher prices and, in many cases, double or triple their current interest rate, are causing them to rethink their decision to move.”Don't missAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)30-year fixed-rate mortgagesThe average 30-year fixed-rate is 6.27%, slightly down from last week when the rate was at 6.31%, Freddie Mac reported Thursday.At this time a year ago, the 30-year home loan was only 3.05%.“Rates have declined significantly over the past six weeks, which is helpful for potential homebuyers, but new data indicates homeowners are hesitant to list their homes,” says Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.“Many of those homeowners are carefully weighing their options as more than two-thirds of current homeowners have a fixed mortgage rate of below 4%.”15-year fixed-rate mortgagesThe average 15-year fixed rate actually increased to 5.69%, compared to the previous week’s rate of 5.54%. Last year, the rate was at 2.30%.Story continuesExisting home sales plunged 37% in November from January’s high, “as buyers were confronted with the insurmountable wall of still-high housing costs and surging interest rates,” writes Ratiu.“November’s unseasonably warm weather across large swaths of the country, combined with mortgage rates which dropped from a peak of 7.08% early in the month to around 6.6% by the end, may have offered a reprieve to home shoppers looking for the right opportunity.”“However, even as listing prices continued their retreat from the summer’s record-highs, affordability remained a central challenge for November buyers,” he says.Read more: 4 easy alternatives to grow your hard-earned cash without the shaky stock marketConsumer confidence rises — but Americans still unlikely to buyAmericans are now more confident in the economy, due to slowing inflation and an excellent November jobs report, according to recent data from The Conference Board, a nonprofit business think tank.The group’s survey revealed consumer confidence in the U.S. hit an eight-month high in December, but demand for big purchases like homes has dropped.“Vacation intentions improved but plans to purchase homes and big-ticket appliances cooled further,” says Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board.“This shift in consumers’ preference from big-ticket items to services will continue in 2023, as will headwinds from inflation and interest rate hikes.”Mortgage applications rise for a second weekMortgage applications increased 0.9% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).“This is a particularly slow time of year for homebuying, so it is not surprising that purchase applications did not move much in response to lower mortgage rates,” says Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the MBA.However, refinance activity surged by 6% as homeowners sought out savings on their monthly payments with lower mortgage rates.“The latest data on the housing market show that homebuilders are pulling back the pace of new construction in response to low levels of traffic, and we expect this weakness in demand will persist in 2023, as the U.S. is likely to enter a recession,” says Fratantoni.“However, if mortgage rates continue to trend down, as we are forecasting, more buyers are likely to return to the market later in the year, as affordability improves with both lower rates and slower home-price growth.”What to read next'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysWant to invest your spare change but don't know where to start?

Santa's Crypto 'Naughty' List 2022,Business,/news/santas-crypto-naughty-list-2022-164458098.html,"The cryptocurrency industry has seen more than its fair share of controversy, fraud, and questionable decisions this year. From the downfall of the ambitious Terra blockchain helmed by tall-talking Do Kwon to its domino effect on now-bankrupt firms and the stunning collapse of FTX, a new crop of controversial figures emerged—and they’re on Santa’s naughty list. Sam Bankman-FriedOnce a mainstream media darling, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried turned from hero to villain when FTX collapsed this year. FTX’s bankruptcy and the subsequent unraveling of SBF's “effective altruism” routine, allegations of fraud and misusing customer funds, secret political donations, and reports of a racy Bahamas “polycule” land SBF at the top of Decrypt’s naughty list. (As the biggest newsmaker of the year by far, he's also our Person of the Year.)Just months before FTX’s bankruptcy, SBF had positioned himself as a crypto savior of sorts, offering to bail out companies like Voyager Digital and BlockFi, which had become insolvent due to exposure to Do Kwon’s Terra—which itself collapsed in May. FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in BahamasSBF had said he had billions to spare—but all that money quickly vanished when FTX experienced a bank run following revelations that its sister company, Alameda Research, was essentially broke. Alameda, as it turned out, mostly held illiquid tokens on its balance sheet, and much of that was in FTT—FTX’s own token.As reports began to surface about SBF allegedly misusing customer funds and funneling assets through Alameda, SBF revealed that he was never the regulation-friendly corporate Democrat he had positioned himself to be. In reality, SBF made an equal amount of “dark” donations to the Republican party, and admitted to a Vox reporter that his interest in “effective altruism” was largely a sham. Caroline EllisonCaroline Ellison is the former CEO of Alameda Research, FTX’s sister company which has been accused of mishandling FTX customer funds to participate in high-risk leveraged trades in the billions of dollars. In addition to her high-risk trades, a Tumblr blog linked to Ellison also suggests an interest in Nazi-adjacent philosophies such as race science. The account also advocated for “imperial Chinese harem” polyamory and sported the username “Fake Charity Nerd Girl.” Story continuesTumblr Blog Linked to Ex-Alameda CEO Explored Race Science, ‘Imperial Chinese Harem’ PolyamoryDo KwonDo Kwon is the CEO of Terraform Labs and founder of the Terra blockchain and its failed algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD, or UST, which destabilized from its peg in May of this year, causing the prices of both UST and LUNA to crash. This was a major economic shock to the crypto industry, and third party exposure to Terraform Labs, UST, and LUNA created a ripple effect and sent BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and other firms into deep financial trouble. But not only was Kwon the CEO behind the now-collapsed project and its associated tokens, but he was also well-known for his overconfident attitude on Crypto Twitter. He later said that he developed the persona for “entertainment value” and regretted “shitposting” so much on the social media platform. Now, Kwon is on Interpol’s Red Notice list, no longer allowed to have a South Korean passport, and is facing a $57 million class-action lawsuit in Singapore, among other concerns. His current location remains unknown, though he denies being “on the run” from authorities. Terra Co-Founder Do Kwon: I Am Not 'On the Run'Elon MuskOh, Elon. The Tesla, SpaceX, and Boring Company CEO also became (reluctantly) the CEO of Twitter this year. After trying to back out from a $44 billion acquisition deal, Musk bought Twitter and immediately shook things up—dramatically. He began firing the majority of Twitter’s workforce, put Twitter’s crypto products on hold, told employees to become “extremely hardcore” or leave, eliminated employee benefits, and started putting beds inside Twitter’s headquarters. While he’s yet to solve Twitter’s persistent bot problem, he did allow anyone to buy a blue checkmark for a few days—causing advertisers to pull out en masse and major confusion as seemingly “verified” users impersonated brands. Are Elon Musk’s Crypto Plans for Twitter Changing?And when it comes to crypto, Musk has paper hands. Tesla sold 75% of its Bitcoin in July this year because it said “Bitcoin impairment” affected the company’s overall profitability. Tesla dumped roughly $936 million of Bitcoin back onto the market despite Musk’s promise in 2021 that Tesla would not sell “any Bitcoin” that it owned.Jesse Powell While Jesse Powell’s San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken remains afloat, Powell hasn’t exactly played the “nice guy” this year. He announced that he’s stepping back from his CEO role. And Kraken has faced multiple waves of staff layoffs despite the company asserting back in June that it was going to have a “global hiring push,” had not changed its “hiring plan” and would not layoff staff, instead claiming it still had “over 500 roles to fill” in 2022. Powell has also taken issue with anyone who wishes to discuss “pronouns,” called American women “brainwashed,” and previously said that the N-word, in his view, wasn’t a slur if used affectionately. Yikes.Changpeng “CZ” Zhao Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao makes our ""Naughty"" and our “Nice” list this year, largely for the same reason: the tweet that brought down FTX (whether CZ chooses to see it this way or not).Some quick background: As an early investor in FTX, Binance gained a large share of FTT tokens—5% of the entire supply—when FTX bought out Binance’s equity in the company last year.When it came out that most of the assets on Alameda’s balance sheet were FTT tokens, CZ tweeted that he planned to begin selling off Binance’s holdings of FTT, ""due to recent revelations that have came to light."" That tweet evidently inspired other FTT holders to follow suit, and the selloff collapsed the price of the token. This, in turn, led to a bank run on FTX, and the liquidity crunch then quickly forced the exchange to shut down and subsequently file for bankruptcy.FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Was a ‘Master Manipulator,’ Says Binance CEO CZZhao rejects the idea that his tweets may have led to or accelerated FTX’s bankruptcy, writing in December that “no healthy business can be destroyed by a tweet.” That may be true, but there’s no denying what CZ’s tweet did for market sentiment.And while there’s an argument to be made that helping to expose the FTX fraud for what it was is a net positive for crypto long-term (which is why CZ also makes the “Nice” list), FTX customers who still have funds trapped on the exchange probably wish things had worked out differently.Avraham Eisenberg, Mango Markets hackerWhat’s a crypto naughty list without hackers? In October, the Solana DeFi platform Mango Markets suffered a massive $100 million hack. Mango Markets said that the attack occurred through price manipulation of an oracle. The platform’s liquidity was drained, and it had to halt deposits. Thankfully, some of the funds were eventually recovered.Avraham Eisenberg later identified himself as a part of the team that hacked the protocol, behavior he said was legal. He later tried another exploit on the Aave protocol, but failed and lost millions.BNB bridge hacker Binance’s Smart Chain Bridge was hacked for a staggering $570 million in October. But Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that nearly 90% of the swiped tokens were successfully frozen on the blockchain, and the Binance Smart Chain was brought to a halt. Shortly after, Binance burned roughly 2 billion BNB tokens in its 21st quarterly token burn, a move which helped make up for the losses incurred as a result of the hack.Binance 'Narrowing Down' Identity of $570M Smart Chain Bridge AttackerLazarus It should go without saying that any group of North Korean crypto hackers easily qualify for Santa’s naughty list. Lazarus is a North Korea-backed hacker group that has attacked crypto firms in Japan and was blamed for the massive $622 million Ronin bridge hack earlier this year. It’s also been accused of being behind the $100 million Harmony Protocol hack.What’s their strategy? The group often uses phishing scams, posing as companies or other entities with links and attachments that contain malware. In fact, Lazarus was so destructive this year that the U.S. government said Lazarus’ repeated use of Tornado Cash was a main reason that the Treasury Department sanctioned the privacy mixing protocol this year.""Monkey Drainer""All your Apes gone? It might have been the notorious “Monkey Drainer” hacker. The NFT “drainer” tool has netted thieves an estimated $4.3 million or more this year. While Monkey Drainer is likely one person—as blockchain examiner ZachXBT previously told Decrypt—its creator is also likely selling their malware drainer tool as a service to other aspiring attackers, with its creator taking a percentage of the ill-gotten gains. Pixelmon founder “Syberer”Would you pay $8,000 for an ugly stock rendering of a pixelated creature? Neither would we. But back in February, the NFT market saw unprecedented speculation—and collections launched at sky-high prices left and right. The Pixelmon Ethereum NFTs were designed to be characters for an upcoming Pokemon-esque Web3 game. At a pricy 3 ETH mint ($8,100 at the time), expectations were high. When the NFT artwork was revealed, holders felt cheated by the low quality of the assets, and the collection became the laughing stock of Crypto Twitter for weeks. $70 Million Later, Pixelmon's Founder Calls Artwork Reveal 'Horrible Mistake'But one particular Pixelmon—a green, Frankenstein-like creature—became an internet sensation precisely because he was so ugly. Crypto Twitter named him Kevin. Kevin’s shockingly ugly mug inspired NFT degens the world over to spawn derivative collections using his name and visage. Pixelmon founder Syberer, also known as Syber, admitted the first round of NFT artwork—which garnered them $70 million—was a “horrible mistake.” The project took months to revamp the collection’s artwork and improve upon the original designs, which were partly derived from stock models.

The FTX Trade That’s Tempting Oaktree and Baupost: Credit Weekly,Business,/news/ftx-trade-tempting-oaktree-baupost-210000381.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Editor’s Note: Welcome to Credit Weekly, where Bloomberg’s global team of reporters will catch you up on the hottest stories of the past week while also offering you a peek into what to expect in credit markets for the days ahead.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk Warns Against Margin Debt on Risk of Market ‘Mass Panic’Power Outages, Flight Delays as US Storm Leaves Trail of ChaosChina Estimates Covid Surge Is Infecting 37 Million People a DayEastern US Power Grid Orders Cuts Amid System-Wide EmergencyAlameda’s Former CEO Ellison Said She, Bankman-Fried Misled FTX LendersIt will be months, if not years, before FTX’s customers know how much they’ll get back from the failed crypto exchange. But as Bloomberg’s Justina Lee and Rachel Butt reported this week, some of the world’s savviest distressed debt investors are already looking to make a play.For such firms, which profit by picking through the ruins of failed companies, bankruptcies this size don’t come around often. That helps to explain why the likes of Baupost Group and Oaktree Capital Management have inquired about buying claims of customers with assets stuck on the exchange. (Both firms declined to comment to Bloomberg News.)The calculus behind any ultimate bets is tricky. First, customers would need to become desperate enough to accept a fraction of what they’re owed — via a transaction known as a claims trade — in return for getting some cash now.The initial numbers weren’t promising. Restructuring professionals tasked with overseeing the FTX cleanup, led by one-time Enron liquidator John J. Ray III, tallied up $7.9 billion of liabilities owed by the main units of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. That compares with more than $1 billion of digital assets turned up so far, and about $1.2 billion of cash. A lawyer representing FTX’s estate told a judge last month that a substantial amount of the firm’s assets “ have either been stolen or are missing.”Story continuesIf the missing assets don’t turn up, prospective claims buyers will be weighing the odds that FTX’s caretakers can find them elsewhere. FTX has already hinted at clawing back donations to political groups, and there may be assets to recover in the Bahamas. FTX caretakers are also trying to get their hands on $440 million of Robinhood Markets Inc. shares tied to Bankman-Fried’s former trading house, Alameda Research.Claims traders will also need to assess whether the value of customers’ crypto assets can rebound. At less than $17,000, Bitcoin still trades substantially below its $50,000 level of a year ago, but also well above its sub-$10,000 levels in the pre-pandemic era.Japan ShockerThe Bank of Japan jolted the nation’s debt markets this week when it raised its cap on 10-year bond yields. The move rekindled worries that a broader policy shift by the BOJ — the last holdout in a world of inflation-fighting central banks — will cause bigger disruptions.As Bloomberg’s Ayai Tomisawa wrote, one key measure that investors will be watching is the cost of hedging against losses on the yen. Amid a surging dollar, those hedging costs jumped in the past year. That, along with plunging bond prices in the US and Europe, prompted Japanese investors to pull back from buying debt in overseas markets.This was a big deal for some of the world’s largest fixed income markets, including US corporate bonds, because Japanese investors were a significant part of the buyer base. Many investors are now looking for an opportunity to chase yields overseas again once hedging costs ease.China DevelopersChina stepped up support for its debt-laden property sector, with its central bank saying it will guide financial institutions to support mergers and acquisitions in the industry and help defuse risks and improve financial conditions of top-tier developers. China’s securities regulator also said it will allow qualified developers to secure a backdoor listing via listed peers. Beijing’s policy bazooka has fueled an advance in the bonds and shares of developers, although there are signs the rally is faltering.Meanwhile, a key domestic unit of Country Garden Holdings Co., China’s top developer by sales, plans to sell as much as 1 billion yuan ($143 million) of three-year onshore bonds and was expected to start building orders on Thursday. It’s the latest bond issuance under a state-guarantee program that first emerged in August.Elsewhere:Kazakh financial firms have been scooping up Russian government debt at a steep discount from investors unable to exit the market because of sanctions and other restrictions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg NewsGoldman Sachs is in discussions with investors about selling around $4 billion of subordinated debt that lenders backing the buyout of Citrix Systems have held for months, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The timing of the transaction is dependent on the release of new audited financials, which aren’t expected until the new year, said the people.So-called negative carry in closed-end municipal bond funds, driven by the sharp increase in short-term bond yields, is putting funds at risk of more dividend cutsPrivate equity firms are getting a preview of what 2023 has in store for them.

AOL co-founder: Silicon Valley will remain 'leader' of the startup world,Business,/news/aol-co-founder-silicon-valley-will-remain-leader-of-the-startup-world-152632395.html,"In recent years, entrepreneurship has spread outside of hotbeds like the Bay Area, with vibrant startups emerging in unlikely cities such as St. Louis, Atlanta, and Chattanooga.Still, Steve Case, the former CEO of AOL, insists that Silicon Valley remains the most powerful player in the startup world.“It is the leader of the pack and will continue to be the leader of the pack, the most vibrant startup ecosystem really in the world that will continue,” Case recently told Yahoo Finance. “We're not talking about the fall of Silicon Valley, we're talking about the rise of dozens of other cities to create this more dispersed innovation economy.”The startup scene in Silicon Valley dates back the 40s, when Frederick Terman, the dean of the Stanford University School of Engineering, began encouraging faculty and alumni to start companies. In 1951, he created the Stanford Industrial Park, which served as the headquarters of companies like Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Varian Associates.The late 50s saw further innovation when eight of Nobel Prize Winner William Shockley's top researchers resigned from his lab and founded Fairchild Semiconductor. The company would go on to build the first integrated circuit, a key a key component of modern electronic devices that helped establish the Bay Area as the tech innovation hub.By the early 70s large amounts venture capital money began flowing into Silicon Valley with the founding of venture capital firms like Kleiner-Perkins and Sequoia Capital.Steve Case, Chairman and CEO of Revolution and Co-Founder of AOL, speaks during the ""Adjusting to the Tech Revolution: Surfing the Wave or Swept Away?"" panel discussion at the 2014 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California April 29, 2014. REUTERS/Kevork Djansezian (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY)Consequently, venture capital money flow into Silicon Valley with the founding of some of the world's largest venture capital firms like Kleiner-Perkins and Sequoia Capital in the early 70s.“Silicon Valley rose up, a number of things kind of came together. Certainly, great universities like Stanford, a sense of a possibility. A lot of people moved to California because it was sort of a pioneering spirit, even the Gold Rush and that, that mentality to help inspire, you know, people,” Case said. “But also, that's kind of where venture capital really was based. It a little bit started in New York, but the center of gravity really was in San Francisco. And then you created this increasing returns dynamic where there more and more of the money was there.”Story continuesDespite Silicon Valley’s rich history of business innovation, 2021 has seen an increase in venture capital funding outside of the Bay Area. For the first time in a decade, less than 30 percent of total U.S. venture capital has gone to Silicon Valley, according to a report produced by Rise of the Rest Seed Fund and PitchBook.For the last decade, Case, who co-founded AOL in 1985, has toured the United States by bus in search of promising entrepreneurs and startups outside of the Valley. His Washington, D.C. venture capital firm, Revolution LLC, has invested in nearly 200 companies in more than 100 cities. He argues that companies outside of traditional startup hubs should garner more attention from investors.“I think it’s shifted from a something where people thought it was a little on the fringe to now recognizing some really significant companies that are being built in different parts of the country,” Case said. “And it makes sense to be broadening your aperture beyond where you happen to be, whether it be San Francisco or New York or Boston and look for the opportunities in other places.”In his book “The Rise of the Rest: How Entrepreneurs in Surprising Places are Building the New American Dream,” which was released in September, Case profiles 30 innovative new companies from unexpected places. For instance, he writes about Catalyte, a software company based in Baltimore that uses AI to find and train software engineers. He also spotlights Appharvest, a sustainable food company in Kentucky that offers a more efficient alternative to traditional agriculture companies.“It really is remarkable what's bubbling out there. And I really do believe over the next decade, it will accelerate,” Case said. “And, 10 years from now, we will recognize Silicon Valley is still the leader, but will have a much more diverse innovation. economy, much more inclusive innovation economy, which I think will be good for those communities and frankly good for the country.”Case oversaw the merger of AOL and Time Warner in 2001 and became chairman of the board. He resigned from the position in 2003. Yahoo and AOL are both owned by the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.Dylan Croll is a reporter and researcher at Yahoo Finance.

How Much Do I Have to Pay in Taxes With a Side Job?,Business,/news/much-pay-taxes-side-job-140002443.html,"how to avoid paying taxes on side jobsThe gig economy pads the budgets of millions of Americans  — but there are tax implications from taking a side job. Fortunately, you can reduce the taxes on your side jobs, depending on your situation.For help figuring out how a side job will impact your taxes, consider working with a financial advisor.Do You Have to Report Your Income From Side Jobs?Federal tax law obligates you to report income from side jobs. Although taxes might automatically come out of your paycheck from your day job, your side hustle creates self-employment income. As a result, it’s up to you to report this income when filing taxes. Failure to do so can result in heavy financial penalties.The only exception to this rule is if you’re under 65 and fulfill one of the following conditions:You file your taxes single and make less than $12,550 this year.You file jointly and make less than $25,100 or $26,450 this year if one spouse is over 65 and one is less than 65.You file as head of household and make less than $18,800 this year.You’re married filing separately and make less than $5 this year.You file as a qualifying widow or widower and make less than $25,100 this year.Generally, it’s a good idea to file taxes even if you fall under the income threshold for having to file. You might qualify for specific tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit, that can create a profitable refund from the government. Therefore, reporting income from side jobs is mandatory if you are above the income threshold for your filing type and likely financially beneficial if you are below it.How Much Do You Have to Pay in Taxes with a Side Job?Typically, you’ll pay self-employment taxes of 15.3%. In addition, you’ll pay income taxes per your tax bracket. Income taxes range from 10% to 37%, depending on your income level and filing status. Therefore, it’s recommended to designate at least 25% of your income for tax payments.You’ll likely receive a 1099 form for your side job income (as opposed to the W-2 you’ll receive from your employer of your nine to five) by January 31. While a W-2 shows your income with taxes already deducted, a 1099 form shows how much money you made as an independent contractor.Story continuesRemember, you’ll receive one 1099 form per side hustle. For example, if you are an Uber driver and run an Airbnb, you’ll get a 1099 from each company detailing how much money you made from working with each. If you made less than $600 at one of your side hustles, you might not receive a 1099. In this case, you’ll still need to report the income if it’s over $400.How to Pay Your Estimated Tax BillYou’ll pay your estimated self-employment income tax bill quarterly. Therefore, you’ll owe taxes according to the following schedule:You pay taxes on April 15 for income received from January 1 through March 31.You pay taxes on June 15 for income received from April 1 through May 31.You pay taxes on September 15 for income received from June 1 through August 31.You pay taxes on January 15 for income received from September 1 through December 31.To submit payment, you have several options:Pay on the IRS’s website (irs.gov/payments) with a debit or credit card.Business owners can pay over the phone and online after enrolling in the Electronic Federal Tax Payment Services.Download the IRS2Go app and pay on your smartphone or tablet.Mail a check or money order to your local IRS office.In addition, after the tax year, you’ll file taxes as usual on April 15. You’ll use Form 1099-NEC from each of your side hustles. This form defines how much money you made as a non-employee of a company. For example, if you are an Instacart driver in 2022, you’ll receive Form 1099-NEC from the company by January 31, 2023, showing your income. Then, you have until April 15 to file taxes for 2022.  The income from 1099-NEC will go into Form 1040 Schedule C when you file. Remember, you’ll perform quarterly filings and the year-end filing.What Happens if You Don’t Pay Taxes on Your Side Job?how to avoid paying taxes on side jobsNot paying taxes on your side job will result in financial penalties from the IRS. Specifically, the IRS will charge the taxes due on the income plus the effective interest rate for that quarter. As a result, you’ll pay the taxes owed plus a percentage as a penalty. In addition, you might incur a 0.5% penalty for each month you didn’t pay your taxes.That said, the IRS won’t penalize you if you make quarterly tax payments that are slightly off target. As long as you pay at least 90% of your taxes owed throughout the year, you won’t suffer financial penalties for unpaid taxes (provided that you make up the difference on your annual tax return).How to Avoid Paying Taxes on Side JobsWhile you can’t completely avoid paying taxes on your side hustles, itemizing deductions when you file taxes can minimize your tax burden. For example, the following strategies can lower your taxes:Ordinary and Necessary Expenses For Your BusinessAs a self-employed tax filer, some of your expenses are considered ordinary and necessary. Ordinary expenses are unavoidable costs for running your business. For example, the costs of office supplies and legally required insurance policies are tax-deductible.On the other hand, necessary expenses are helpful but not vital to your work. For instance, you can deduct 50% of the costs for meals over which you discuss business. So, it’s crucial to keep every receipt for ordinary and necessary expenses to maximize this deduction.Business ExpensesWhile W-2 employees have limited access to work-related deductions, self-employed workers have more latitude. For example, numerous side hustles require vehicle use. Therefore, you can usually deduct costs for fuel, repairs, registration fees and insurance.In addition, you can deduct cell phone costs if you use your phone for work. For instance, if half your phone usage is business-related, you can deduct 50% of your monthly phone bill from your taxes.Home Office DeductionIf you use your home to run your side hustle or small business, you can take advantage of the home office deduction. To do so, you must have a designated space you use exclusively and regularly for work. In addition, this space must be the primary spot where you run your business. Certain business types, such as storage, daycare and hospitality, don’t qualify for this deduction.Track Your ExpensesKeeping detailed records is essential to maximizing your deductions. In addition, you’ll need to back up the figures on your taxes if the IRS audits you. Therefore, it’s recommended to log all business-related receipts, record expenses and create a system that allows you to organize this information. If you have a complex tax situation or need help maximizing your tax return, it’s helpful to work with a tax professional.The Bottom Linehow to avoid paying taxes on side jobsSide hustles can be lucrative, but they also impose taxes on earned income. Moreover, failure to pay these taxes quarterly can incur financial penalties from the IRS. However, by paying the correct amount of taxes on time and maximizing deductions for business-related expenses, you can lower your taxes from side jobs and pocket more of your hard-earned cash.Tax Tips for Side JobsWorking multiple jobs can make tracking expenses and filing at the right time challenging.

Charting the Global Economy: BOJ Shocks; US Inflation Cools,Business,/news/charting-global-economy-boj-shocks-100000039.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda shocked markets earlier this week by doubling a cap on 10-year yields, in a move that helps pave the way for possible monetary policy normalization under a new governor.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk Warns Against Margin Debt on Risk of Market ‘Mass Panic’Power Outages, Flight Delays as US Storm Leaves Trail of ChaosChina Estimates Covid Surge Is Infecting 37 Million People a DayEastern US Power Grid Orders Cuts Amid System-Wide EmergencyAlameda’s Former CEO Ellison Said She, Bankman-Fried Misled FTX LendersThe change, which blindsided all 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of the decision, has the potential upend global markets as the cap has helped keep borrowing costs low worldwide. Later in the week, Japan’s key inflation gauge accelerated to the fastest pace since 1981, continuing to fuel speculation the BOJ will surprise markets again.In the US, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge continued to retreat, but wages are still rising much too fast for policymakers’ liking. Real consumer spending flat-lined, but officials will want to see more than a month of data to indicate demand is substantially cooling.Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:AsiaKuroda’s decision to widen the trading band on 10-year bond yields triggered a jump in the yen and roiled global markets. The move shook markets — boosting the yen and bond yields, while sending stocks lower. The implications go far beyond Japan. With the BOJ — the last advanced economy holdout in a global monetary tightening shift — now letting the benchmark yield trade higher than before, the shock will echo across global financial markets.China’s broad budget deficit hit a record so far this year, showing how damaging the now abandoned Covid Zero policy and the ongoing housing slump have been to the economy and to the government’s finances. The augmented fiscal deficit was 7.75 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) in January to November, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the Ministry of Finance.Story continuesEconomic activity continued to fall in December for China’s small firms, with the business outlook weakening further as Covid cases surge amid reopening, according to Standard Chartered Plc. A gauge of business conditions at small and medium enterprises was in contractionary territory for a third straight month in December.US & CanadaUS inflation continued to ease into the end of 2022 and expectations of future increases dropped, reinforcing hopes that the worst bout of price pressures in a generation has finally passed. However, wages are still climbing much too fast as the job market remains tight.US sales of previously owned homes fell for a 10th-straight month in November, extending a record decline as high mortgage rates continue to stifle affordability. Contract signings to buy single-family houses slumped to a 12-year low, while sales of condominiums also dropped.Canada’s inflation rate decelerated in November but key gauges of underlying price pressures trended higher, potentially dashing hopes for a pause in interest-rate increases. Consumer price data show price pressures remain stubbornly high, even as the economy gears down and higher borrowing costs curb domestic demand.EuropeUK household incomes fell for a fourth straight quarter, leaving Britons on course for the worst period for living standards in memory as officials estimated the economy was weaker than previously thought. Adjusted for inflation, disposable income per person declined 0.5% in the third quarter, while gross domestic product fell 0.3%.UK government borrowing surged in November as the public finances came under mounting pressure from rising debt-interest payments and the huge cost of subsidizing energy bills for consumers and businesses. The budget deficit stood at £22 billion ($26.8 billion) –- the highest monthly total in records stretching back to 1993 and almost triple the £8.1 billion reading a year ago.Emerging MarketsVietnam is on track this year to bump Britain from its long-time place among the US’s top seven goods trading partners, which would be the first time the UK hasn’t been in that group in records going back at least to 2004. The UK’s share of the US merchandise trade slid to 2.6% through the first 10 months of this year while Vietnam’s rose to 2.7%, according to US Census Bureau data.After some of the world’s most aggressive interest-rate hikes, Brazil’s inflation has plunged by half in the past six months. That sounds like mission accomplished — except the central bank doesn’t see it that way. While the bank’s benchmark now offers an inflation-adjusted return of almost 8% — a global high among major economies – traders reckon its next move is more likely to be another bout of monetary tightening because of fiscal policy.WorldPolicymakers in Egypt, Morocco and Indonesia raised interest rates this week while those in Hungary, Paraguay and Czech Republic stayed on hold.--With assistance from Zoe Schneeweiss, Ailing Tan, Liza Tetley, Randy Thanthong-Knight, Lin Zhu, Yuki Masujima (Economist), Philip Aldrick, Andrew Atkinson, Maria Eloisa Capurro, John Liu, Brendan Murray and Reade Pickert.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Chatbots Are Coming for GoogleApple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion GiftDrugmakers Are Testing Ways to Stop Alzheimer’s Before It StartsThe Two-Word Mantra That Changed Bank of America’s Risk CultureThe Federal Reserve Doesn’t Care About Your Misery©2022 Bloomberg L.P."
Building a Tax-Efficient Portfolio For Yourself,Business,/news/building-tax-efficient-portfolio-yourself-140030733.html,"Tax-Saving Mutual FundBuilding a tax-efficient portfolio so you can keep more of your investment income and capital gains is a concern of investors the world over. In India, for example, the government has created a “tax-saving mutual fund” with tax benefits in mind. In the United States there are several fund-focused ways to save on taxes, which are described below. Consider working with a financial advisor to build a comprehensive tax planning strategy.India’s Tax-Saving Mutual FundsThose able to invest in India-based securities may be able to put money into one of the country’s tax-saving mutual funds, also referred to as equity-linked saving schemes (ELSS). These are open-ended mutual fund that invest at least 80% of their assets in equities or equity-linked securities. Underlying investments can include small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap companies, depending on the objective of the fund.A tax-saving mutual fund or ELSS, which entails a three-year lockup period, offers various tax benefits. These include tax exemptions for invested amounts and favorable tax treatment of capital gains.Unified Management Accounts (UMAs)In the United States, investors can pursue tax efficiency through both specific types of securities as well as specific types of financial services. One of the most widely used type of securities is unified managed accounts (UMA), which money managers often construct to help achieve tax efficiency in taxable accounts and to simplify yearend tax filing.If you want to open one of these accounts, you’d first work with an advisor, wealth manager or portfolio manager to decide which assets you want to hold inside the UMA. Once those assets are selected, they’re aggregated and collected into the UMA. The next step is developing an investment strategy for managing UMA assets. However, this strategy is different for every investor who uses a UMA and is based on their objectives, diversification needs, the timeline for investing, risk tolerance, risk capacity – and need to minimize taxes.Story continuesUMAs are rebalanced often to keep the account’s asset allocation on track with your needs and preferences. However, rebalancing is approached in a way that keeps your entire comprehensive financial plan, including tax efficiency, in focus.Turnkey Asset Management ProgramsA turnkey asset management program (TAMP) offers another way for investors to achieve tax savings. With a TAMP one or more advisors oversee all of the associated tasks that go along with managing client assets on an individual basis. A TAMP allows advisors to outsource certain tasks so they can focus more of their time and energy on others. For example, a TAMP may outsource reporting and accounting to focus on such priorities as tax savings.Here are three popular TAMPs:Mutual Fund Wrap AccountsA mutual fund wrap account offers multiple mutual funds. Their fees wrap around all of a client’s mutual fund trading activity. As a result, an advisor can design a portfolio of mutual funds tailored to a client’s investment goals. This type of TAMP structure offers a simplified way to manage client assets while reducing fees.Exchange-Traded Fund Wrap AccountsThis type of wrap account resembles a mutual fund. However, investment choices are limited to exchange-traded funds. Cost-efficient ETFs give this type of wrap account slightly lower fees compared to a traditional mutual fund wrap account.Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)A separately managed account is designed for investors with higher levels of investable assets and it operates similarly to a mutual fund with one key difference. Rather than pooling money together from other investors, all of the investments in an SMA are owned by a single investor.Tax Overlay ServicesTax-Saving Mutual FundA tax overlay service (TOS) enables money managers to monitor a client’s separate accounts to ensure that changes in one account don’t work against changes in another account. A TOS, which is often used by the very wealthy, works off software that coordinates the tactics of each account so each one works in coordinated and efficient harmony to advance a client’s overall strategy.This service works to minimize a client’s tax exposure, especially on short-term gains that cannot be deferred. Managers can also use this service to match long-term capital gains with short-term capital losses and tax-loss harvesting.Building a Tax-Efficient Portfolio for YourselfTax-saving mutual funds are just one option for minimizing taxes on investments. If you don’t have the opportunity to invest in an ELSS, you might consider some of these options instead.ETFs: Exchange-traded funds are mutual funds that trade on an exchange like a stock. An ETF can be a tax-efficient addition to a portfolio since they tend to have lower turnover than traditional funds. That means fewer taxable events for investors.Index Funds: An index fund attempts to mimic the performance of an underlying benchmark, such as the S&P 500. Like ETFs, index funds tend to have a lower turnover of underlying assets, so there’s less potential to trigger short-term capital gains.Tax-Managed Funds: A tax-managed fund can offer tax-efficient growth by minimizing taxable dividend income. You can get the benefits of diversification and exposure to equities, without increasing tax liability.Municipal Bonds: Municipal bonds are issued by state, city and local governments. While they may not offer the same degree of performance as a stock-focused fund, any income generated by these bonds is usually tax-exempt at the federal level.Bottom LineA tax-saving mutual fund offers a unique path to minimizing taxation for investors. As an added plus, they typically have a lower barrier to entry, making them accessible to those who are just getting started in the market. Whether it makes sense to invest in one of these funds can depend on your tax situation and risk tolerance.Tax Tips for InvestorsTax-Saving Mutual FundConsider talking to a financial advisor about how to manage and minimize taxes. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be difficult. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

This can help you plan your finances for the following year.Asset location is just as important as asset allocation for managing taxes as an investor. Contributing to a 401(k) or IRA are two simple ways to enjoy some tax benefits while building long-term wealth. Your contributions may be tax-deductible and in the case of a Roth IRA, qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you don’t have an IRA yet, it’s easy to open one through an online brokerage.Photo credit: ©iStock.com/Yauhen Akulich, ©iStock.com/Moyo Studio, ©iStock.com/Seiya TabuchiThe post A Guide to Tax-Saving Mutual Funds appeared first on SmartAsset Blog."
Pound’s Tentative Recovery Masks Worst Year Since Brexit Vote,Business,/news/pound-tentative-recovery-masks-worst-080000195.html,"(Bloomberg) --Most Read from BloombergElon Musk Warns Against Margin Debt on Risk of Market ‘Mass Panic’Power Outages, Flight Delays as US Storm Leaves Trail of ChaosChina Estimates Covid Surge Is Infecting 37 Million People a DayEastern US Power Grid Orders Cuts Amid System-Wide EmergencyAlameda’s Former CEO Ellison Said She, Bankman-Fried Misled FTX LendersA turbulent year for the pound is coming to an end with little evidence that 2023 will be much different.Signs of a painful UK economic downturn keep piling up, making analysts doubtful that the currency can extend — or even sustain — a recent rebound against the dollar. The options market also shows skepticism, with traders still gloomy over the long run.The pound has surged from an all-time low reached in September boosted by a change of government following Liz Truss’ ill-fated tenure as leader and a weakening dollar. But it’s still down 11% in 2022, headed for its worst year since the Brexit vote in 2016.Going into next year, room for gains may be limited by divergence in central bank policy, with the Bank of England looking increasingly dovish compared with peers. Also the UK economy is reeling, the budget deficit has rocketed and double-digit inflation has led to the sharpest drop in living standards on record, curbing spending and giving rise to the worst industrial unrest in decades. The housing market also looks vulnerable to a sharp correction.“The UK is in the vanguard for economies lurching into recession,” said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank. “The combination of a heel-dragging BOE on further tightening and austere fiscal picture could set up further declines” on the pound.Here are four charts that offer further clues to the pound’s trajectory in 2023:The pound erased losses triggered by Truss’ efforts for vast funded tax cuts within two weeks, but it took more than two months for one-year risk reversals to return to pre-budget levels. The slow recovery of this widely followed barometer of market sentiment suggests traders remain strongly downbeat the pound over the long run and that the rebound in the spot market was more based on positioning rather than an outright bullish expression.Story continuesLeveraged funds switched to be net short on the pound in the week to Dec. 13, after previously being long, while asset managers retained a short position, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.From a technical standpoint, there are mixed signals for the pound. What stands out is a so-called bearish moving averages crossover that unfolds on the monthly chart, at a time when Bloomberg’s fear-greed indicator shows bears are still in control of price action despite the rebound seen in the fourth quarter. This suggests that downside risks prevail for the pound over the medium-term.JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts see sterling heading back to $1.14 by the end of the first quarter, from around $1.21 now, citing their “particularly-negative view” of the UK’s growth outlook. Also local elections looming in May could spell further political uncertainty.Strategists surveyed by Bloomberg see the pair dropping to $1.17 in the first quarter before staging a mild recovery to $1.21 by end-2023.Yield spreads between two- and 10-year swaps tied to the overnight rate — a gauge of recession risks — also point to a longer economic downturn in the UK than in its main peers. The difference between one-year forward and current spreads suggest yield curves in Europe and the US will steepen more than in the UK.The pound can also weaken against other major currencies. Strategists at Rabobank, Commerzbank AG and TD Securities see the euro strengthening to 0.90 pence as soon as June, compared to 0.88 now, as the European Central Bank amps up its rhetoric on the need for more rate hikes, a contrast to the BOE’s more dovish stance.Sterling may also weaken versus the yen as the Bank of Japan is seen edging toward tighter policy. The pair may be heading back toward 120, according to Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist at Societe Generale SA, a level it hasn’t touched in more than a decade.--With assistance from James Hirai.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Chatbots Are Coming for GoogleApple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion GiftDrugmakers Are Testing Ways to Stop Alzheimer’s Before It StartsThe Two-Word Mantra That Changed Bank of America’s Risk CultureThe Federal Reserve Doesn’t Care About Your Misery©2022 Bloomberg L.P."
"This Week in Coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum See Modest Gains Heading Into Christmas",Business,/news/week-coins-bitcoin-ethereum-see-171103868.html,"This week in coins. Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.The crypto market is limping into the new year, but the week heading into Christmas brought very modest gains for the two leading coins. As of Saturday morning, Bitcoin (BTC) is up nearly 1% over the past seven days and Ethereum (ETH) is up nearly 4%, according to CoinMarketCap data.Top memecoin Dogecoin faced notably heavier losses this week. The value of one DOGE is 8.8% lower than it was this time last week and it currently trades for $0.077119. Dogecoin’s popularity waned this week when the cryptocurrency’s number one fan, Twitter/Tesla CEO Elon Musk, tweeted a poll asking whether he should step down from Twitter. The majority of respondents, some 10 million people, voted “Yes.” Much yikes, very ouch.Double-digit percentage losses were felt by holders of Solana (SOL), which crashed 15% to $11.86. Cardano (ADA) dropped 13% to $0.259728, Polkadot (DOT) sank 14% to $4.47, Avalanche (AVAX) fell 10% to $11.78, and Quant (QNT) dropped 12% to $105. Ethereum Classic (ETC), Uniswap (UNI), Litecoin (LITE) and Polygon (MATIC) all posted similar losses of around 9%. Finally, there were whispers in Washington this week that the FTX debacle could spell the end of centralized crypto exchanges. The SEC has escalated its assault on the crypto industry via the investigation. The agency is targeting FTX bigwigs for securities fraud by labeling the exchange’s native token FTT as a security. It’s a subtle semantic shift, implying the SEC now views the token as a security in itself regardless of how it was marketed to consumers. With another year about to close, it’s worth zooming out and considering where 2022 fits into the crypto narrative. It was another rollercoaster year, but unlike the heady peaks of 2021, this was most certainly a painful trough for everyone in the industry in some way or another. Bitcoin more than halved over the course of the year (though there's still a week left for a miracle to happen) while Ethereum depreciated by a factor of three. Such heavy losses among the two market leaders obviously didn’t bode well for the wider market, either. Story continuesBut this was a year in which the industry needed to learn important lessons, and learn them it did, through a tried-and-tested, ancient method: failure. Central to the 2022 bear run were the historic collapses of the Terra ecosystem (both LUNA and its algorithmic stablecoin UST) and the centralized FTX exchange. The contagion from both events spread far across the industry, bankrupting many firms and providing us with case studies in what not to do. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s popularity among retail investors—regular Joes as opposed to institutional investors, like Tesla and MicroStrategy—exponentially grew over the course of the year. In 2020, just 12% of the total supply was in the people’s hands, but by now, that figure has blown up to a little over 17%, an all-time high proportion. "
ECB’s Schnabel Says Rates Need to Reach ‘Restrictive’ Level,Business,/news/ecb-schnabel-says-rates-reach-075631299.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk Warns Against Margin Debt on Risk of Market ‘Mass Panic’Power Outages, Flight Delays as US Storm Leaves Trail of ChaosChina Estimates Covid Surge Is Infecting 37 Million People a DayEastern US Power Grid Orders Cuts Amid System-Wide EmergencyAlameda’s Former CEO Ellison Said She, Bankman-Fried Misled FTX LendersEuropean Central Bank Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel says interest rates will have to move into “restrictive territory” to bring inflation back to target.The danger of a policy overreaction by the ECB “continues to be limited, as real interest rates are still very low,” Schnabel said in an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung conducted Dec. 16, a day after the central bank’s most recent policy meeting, and posted on Saturday.Reflecting on the ECB’s string of four interest rate hikes, Schnabel said the central bank is doing “whatever is necessary” to bring inflation back to 2%. She echoed the position of ECB President Christine Lagarde, who has said rate increases will continue “for a period of time.”“According to our assessment, this interest rate lies in restrictive territory – that is, above the neutral interest rate – even if the exact level is yet unknown,” Schabel said.With the central bank now pointing to a terminal rate higher than many market participants had expected, “achieving consensus” on the next steps “will certainly not get any easier,” Schabel said.Read more: ECB Hikes by Half Point as Lagarde Warns of More Such MovesThe Germany policy-maker said the ECB underestimated the persistence of inflation earlier, “and initially did not take the signs of higher inflation seriously enough” as it pivoted from a phase where too-low inflation had been the main risk and pandemic-related uncertainty shadowed policy decisions.“There was a concern that premature action by monetary policy might unnecessarily push the economy into another recession,” she said.Story continues“Many people” underestimated the surge in prices as Covid-19 measures faded, Schnabel said. “They thought that the supply chain disruptions would be resolved more quickly. But that took much longer than expected.”ECB projections anticipate inflation “notably” above 2% over an extended period likely to run into 2025.“A long phase of very high inflation – as we are currently seeing – is therefore problematic. It makes it all the more important for us to react decisively,” said Schabel. “With inflation at times exceeding 10%, we can hardly speak of price stability.”Also on Saturday, ECB Governing Council member Pierre Wunsch told the Belgian newspaper L’Echo that “the consensus is very clear” within the central bank: “We have a long way to go before we have a monetary policy that is tight enough to ensure that we get back to our 2% inflation target fairly quickly.”“I’m very comfortable with the message that Christine Lagarde gave, which reflects very well the thinking of the vast majority of the Board, that we should expect several more rate hikes,” he added.Schnabel told FAZ that said she expects “increasing pushback” to rate increases of the kind recently seen from Italy. “Governments generally don’t like interest rate hikes very much,” Schabel said. “They weigh on the fiscal position as it becomes more expensive for states to issue new debt.”The ECB “can expect increasing pushback and we need to withstand it. That’s exactly why central banks are independent,” she said.(Updates with Wunsch comments in 11th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Chatbots Are Coming for GoogleApple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion GiftDrugmakers Are Testing Ways to Stop Alzheimer’s Before It StartsThe Two-Word Mantra That Changed Bank of America’s Risk CultureThe Federal Reserve Doesn’t Care About Your Misery©2022 Bloomberg L.P."

Is Margin Interest Tax Deductible?,Business,/news/margin-interest-tax-deductible-140004836.html,"Is Margin Interest Tax Deductible?The world of investing is vast, exciting and often expensive for individual traders. Occasionally, you’ll encounter an investment opportunity you don’t want to pass up but can’t quite afford. Fortunately, you can borrow the funds necessary from your broker to acquire the asset and pay margin interest for the loan. Furthermore, you can deduct the cost of trading on margin from your taxes, allowing you to reduce your tax burden while trading assets you don’t have the financial capacity to purchase on your own. Here are the details on margin interest and how to deduct the costs from your taxes.Consider working with a vetted financial advisor to discuss whether the investment makes sense for you and, if so, how you can deduct margin interest from your taxes.What Is Margin Interest?Margin interest is what an investor pays when borrowing money from their broker to purchase an asset. In other words, if you can’t afford an investment, you can take out a loan from your brokerage firm to purchase it.Like taking out a loan from a traditional bank, the margin loan your broker gives accrues interest. As a result, trading on margin leads to interest payments, even if your investment doesn’t yield gains.How to Calculate Margin Interest?Interest rates among all kinds of industries fluctuate, and margin interest is no exception. The investment firm you use, the amount of money you borrow, and how quickly you sell an asset after purchasing will influence your interest rate.To calculate the costs of margin interest, you’ll multiply your loan by your interest rate and divide the result by 360 (the number investment firms use for days in a year). Finally, you’ll multiply the result by the number of days you plan to hold the asset.For example, say you borrow $20,000 to buy stock. Your brokerage firm charges you an effective interest rate of 7.5%, and you believe you’ll make the most profit by selling the stock after holding it for one week.Story continuesSo, you calculate margin interest by first multiplying the loan amount by the interest rate:$20,000 x 0.075 = $1,500Then, divide the result by 360:$1,500/360=$4.16, which is how much interest you accrue per day while the loan is in effect.Finally, multiply the daily interest charge by the number of days you hold the asset:$4.16×7 days = $29.12Therefore, if you trade on margin and buy $20,000 of stock, you’ll pay $29.12 of margin interest when selling the stock one week later (seven days).Is Margin Interest Tax Deductible?Is Margin Interest Tax Deductible?Margin interest is tax deductible if you itemize your deductions. In addition, you can’t deduct more margin interest than your net investment income. Therefore, you must receive net income when combining taxable interest, dividend payments, and short-term capital gains to receive a tax deduction for margin interest paid in the same tax year.In other words, you aren’t eligible to receive a deduction for margin interest if you take the standard deduction when filing taxes or pay $0 of margin interest in the tax year. You also aren’t eligible if you haven’t received any net investment income for the tax year.Lastly, you can carry over margin interest to future tax years. As a result, past tax years of margin interest can create a tax deduction in the current tax year. Remember, you’ll need to itemize your deductions and have net investment income of greater than $0 to apply margin interest deductions.Margin Interest Tax Deduction CapsYour net investment income will cap your margin interest tax deduction for the current tax year. For example, say your investments gave you a net investment income of $1,000, and you have $5,000 of margin interest to deduct from your taxes. However, you can only deduct up to your net investment income for the year ($1,000). Therefore, you can deduct $1,000 of margin interest for this year’s taxes and carry over the remaining $4,000 to future years.The Bottom LineIs Margin Interest Tax Deductible?Margin interest is the cost of borrowing money from your broker to invest in stocks, bonds and other assets you can’t afford. You can deduct margin interest from your taxes by itemizing your deductions and subtracting margin interest costs from your net investment income.Tax law limits how you can apply margin interest deductions. Specifically, you can never deduct more than your investments earn in any given tax year. However, any margin interest you don’t deduct from taxes can apply to future years. As a result, trading on margin can create a tax advantage and an opportunity to purchase a profitable asset you couldn’t otherwise afford.Tips for Margin Interest Tax DeductionsDeducting the maximum amount from your taxes is an excellent way to get ahead financially. Because tax regulations are complex and ever-changing, consider hiring a financial advisor specializing in taxes. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.

How Often Should You Meet With a Financial Advisor?,Business,/news/often-meet-financial-advisor-165024833.html,"how often should you meet with your financial advisorLet’s say you’ve taken the first step and have already decided to speak with a financial advisor. You already know that financial planning and wealth management goals are vital to your long-term financial health, but how often are you supposed speak with your advisor about investments and strategies?A financial advisor could help you best determine if you are on track to meet your long-term financial goals. Find a qualified advisor today.How Often Should You Speak With Your Financial Advisor?Financial planning and management are personalized services, and advisor meetings can vary depending on the degree of help needed. Complicated financial affairs will likely need to be managed and reviewed anywhere from daily to monthly, while individuals with straightforward investments may only need occasional advice.The ideal frequency depends on the client. Many financial advisor clients track their investments through apps and the web, so meeting too frequently can be more burdensome than useful.West Michigan Advisors recommends meeting more when you first open an account so your advisor can get a better feel for your needs. Over time you can meet occasionally to review, and then you should ramp up the frequency as you approach retirement.At the bare minimum you should expect to speak with a financial advisor once a year. Experts recommend meeting at least annually to review your financial strategies as your living circumstances change. These reviews can be in person or via video calls, and many advisors choose to text or email more frequent updates as necessary.When Should You Speak With Your Financial Advisor?how often should you meet with your financial advisorAlthough some individuals only need to speak with their advisors once a year, your specific circumstances may dictate more frequent communication. Some firms offer two meetings within a year, and others prefer to meet clients quarterly. It is always recommended to speak clearly with your advisor about your expectations.Story continuesHowever, there are certain times that you should ask to meet your financial advisor in spite of your scheduled frequency. These include:A change in lifestyle. Marriage, birth, death, divorce and moving can all impact your taxes and debt significantly. These are ideal moments for consulting your advisor.Purchases financed through debt. Buying a new car, a house and launching a business can also heavily influence your financial plan. An advisor can help outline the financial pros and cons of such decisions.Receiving additional funds. Financial advisors can provide insights and recommendations for investing your inheritance or asset sale proceeds, helping you build your wealth smartly.Communication Is KeyIn the end, you are choosing a specific financial advisor because that person or firm offers the services you feel you need. Fee-only financial advisors are preferable, as you can be assured that they are not recommending investments to you in order to pad their bottom line. These professionals charge hourly, monthly or flat fees to advise you and manage your assets, and more frequent meetings may mean more consultation time to be paid.Regardless, you should feel free to contact your advisor before making important decisions that may impact your finances. For example, investors understandably feel nervous during market downturns, especially when account balances fall, but you should speak to your advisor before panic-selling. Financial advisors are there to guide you through major financial decisions, keeping you on track with your financial goals, so you should always feel comfortable speaking about your finances when the occasion calls for it.Bottom Linehow often should you meet with your financial advisorExperts recommend that you meet at least once a year with a financial advisor to discuss your investment plan and review your risk tolerance and cash flow objectives. You should always be clear with your advisor on how often you expect to communicate, as this may vary depending on the financial professional and your specific circumstances.Tips for Building WealthNot sure what investments and strategies will help you meet your long-term goals?

How to Become a Financial Advisor in 6 Steps,Business,/news/become-financial-advisor-6-steps-140004247.html,"What Estate Expenses Are Paid by the Beneficiary?If you’re good with money and working with people, you may be interested in becoming a financial advisor. There’s more than one way to become a financial advisor, of course, and countless certifications and specialties to pursue.But whether you’re changing careers after years of working or just finishing college, there is a clear path to entering this profession. If you’re interested, read our six steps on how to become a financial advisor.If you are looking to grow your financial advisory business once you become an advisor, check out SmartAsset’s SmartAdvisor platform.Step 1: Understand What a Financial Advisor IsA financial advisor is a professional who is paid to give you advice on what to do with your finances. This person can have a variety of certifications that make him or her qualified to recommend different financial products to you and give you advice on building your wealth. A financial advisor will generally help you save more, plan for retirement and help you invest while managing risk.You need to start your step to becoming a financial advisor by understanding the scope of the role. Do your research on what the role entails and how it can differ depending on the background and area of focus for the advisor. If you know any advisors, ask them about the position to get a good idea if it’s right for you. If you don’t know anyone, start networking. Check out our list of top advisors by state and start reaching out.Step 2: Get an Internship and/or JobThe next step in how to become a financial advisor hinges on getting into a financial advisory firm or working with a sole financial advisor. Whether it’s through an internship or being hired on, having your foot in the door will help you while going through the certification process.If you’re still in school, an internship is a great place to start. Relationships you form while interning can either be turned directly into a job after school, or can be great references when you look for a job.Story continuesIf you’re looking for a job, look for a firm that will pay for you to get licensed. You may not need to have any experience in finance, either. A lot of firms are looking for people with sales backgrounds to sell their services, so if you have that experience, talk about it. There’s a chance they’ll give you the on-the-j0b training you need if you show strong sales skills.Step 3: Choose What Type of Financial Advisor You Want to BeWhat Estate Expenses Are Paid by the Beneficiary?Thinking there’s one type of financial advisor is like thinking there’s one type of doctor. The truth is that different advisors specialize in different areas. Still, you’re likely to see two common titles between financial advisors: investment advisors and financial planners.Investment AdvisorsRegistered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professionals that help you pick and manage your investments. They’re focused on providing you an investment strategy to meet your goals and manage your risk. They’re registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are legally required to act in your best interest.Financial PlannerA Certified Financial Planner (CFP) takes a more holistic approach. While this professional does offer investment advice, he or she will also offer services like budgeting, retirement planning and inheritance. CFPs are regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). If they manage clients with over $100 million in assets, they’re likely also known as wealth managers.Step 4: Obtain Necessary Licenses and CertificationsThere are a few licenses you need to be familiar with. These licenses are issued by FINRA upon passing exams. Let’s go over some of the major ones:Series 3 License: You need this license to sell commodities futures.Series 7 License: This license allows you to become a stockbroker or security trader, and it’s required that you work at a FINRA member firm to acquire the license.Series 63 License:  If you want to sell securities, you need the Series 63 License.Series 65 License: This is the license you must have to make recommendations and manage client investments.Series 66 License: The Series 66 is a combo of Series 63 and Series 65. It allows you to sell securities and manage your client’s portfolio.On top of these licenses, if you want to advance your career, you’re going to want to become a CFP. The CFP certification requires four parts, also known as The 4 E’s:Education: You must hold a bachelor’s degree (or higher) in any discipline and complete a CFP Board Registered Program course.Exam: You must pass the CFP exam, which is 170 multiple-choice questions administered in a day with two three-hour sessions.Experience: You need a minimum of 6,000 hours of related professional financial planning experience or 4,000 hours of apprenticeship experience under a CFP professional.Ethics: You’ll be required to sign an Ethics Declaration and the CFP Board will conduct a background check.Step 5: Build Your ClienteleBuilding relationships with clients is the key to your success. You need to make connections and foster them with excellent service. Up until this part in the process, you’ve been building your knowledge. Now is when you get to use it to help others.On top of focusing on your clientele, make connections with other people in adjacent businesses. Connect with a tax accountant or a real estate agent and refer clients to that professional. This karma will be returned and you can grow your businesses together.Step 6: Continue Your EducationIf you haven’t noticed by now, being a financial advisor means you need to constantly stay educated. You better love learning. Regulatory requirements will make it obligatory for you to maintain your license with additional education and exams.Along with regulation, education is a great way to grow your career. For example, you could go on to become a chartered financial analyst (CFA) to increase your ability to analyze investments. This new title can then be marketed to attract clients with different needs.The Bottom LineWhat Estate Expenses Are Paid by the Beneficiary?If you want to know how to become a financial advisor, know that there are multiple routes. While we’ve outlined six steps for you here, the truth is that your path may not follow this exact plan. What’s important is that you start down the path.Tips for Becoming a Financial AdvisorIf you’re wondering how to become a financial advisor, you should start by getting in contact with one. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.The most important qualification to look for in a financial advisor is adherence to fiduciary duty. A fiduciary advisor is legally bound to act in their client’s best financial interests.

Each of these components is calculated separately to determine your total benefit.Computation of the FERS componentUnder age 62 at separation for retirement, OR– age 62 or older with less than 20 years of service: 1: of your high-3 average salary for each year of serviceAge 62 or older at separation with 20 or more years of service: 1.1% of your high-3 average salary for each year of serviceStory continuesComputation of the CSRS componentFirst 5 years of CSRS service: 1.5% of your high-3 average salary for each year of serviceSecond 5 years of CSRS service: 1.75% of your high-3 average salary for each year of serviceAll years of CSRS service over 10: 2% of your high-3 average salary for each year of serviceReductions in a Non-Disability AnnuitySmartAsset: How to Calculate Your High-3 for Federal RetirementHere are four situations that may reduce your federal retirement non-disability benefits:Age. Benefits may be reduced if you retire before the age of 62. However, benefits reductions do not occur if you complete at least 30 years of service, have 20 years of service and retire at age 60, or if you postpone the start date of your annuity.Survivor benefits. When you pass away, your spouse receives a survivor benefit from your federal retirement annuity. Your monthly benefit is reduced to pay for the survivor benefit unless your spouse consents to your election of less than a full survivor annuity. Your annuity benefit is reduced by 10% if your spouse receives a 50% survivor benefit. If their benefit is 25% of your monthly benefit, your reduction is just 5%.CSRS offset. The CSRS portion of your benefit is reduced by 10% of any deposit owed for non-deduction service performed before Oct. 1, 1982. If the deposit was paid before retirement, then there is no deduction.Alternative annuity. You may elect to receive a lump-sum payment equal to your retirement contributions plus a reduced monthly annuity under certain conditions. This “alternative annuity” is only available for non-disability annuitants who have a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition.Disability Retirement ComputationFor federal workers who are retiring due to a disability, the calculation may be different. If you are age 62 or older at retirement or meet the age and service requirements for immediate voluntary retirement, the FERS basic calculation above applies.However, if you are under age 62 at retirement or are not eligible for voluntary immediate retirement, a new formula applies:First 12 months: 60% of your high-3 average salary minus 100% of your Social Security benefit for any month in which you are entitled to Social Security benefits. However, you are entitled to your “earned” annuity, if it is larger than this amount.After 12 months:40% of your high-3 average salary minus 60% of your Social Security benefit for any month in which you are entitled to Social Security disability benefits. However, you are entitled to your “earned” annuity, if it is larger than this amount.When you reach age 62:Your annuity will be recomputed using an amount that essentially represents the annuity you would have received if you had continued working until the day before your 62nd birthday and then retired under FERS.If your actual service plus the credit for time as a disability annuitant equals less than 20 years: 1% of your high-3 average salary for each year of service.If your actual service, plus the credit for time as a disability annuitant equals 20 or more years: 1.1% of your high-3 average salary for each year of service.Total Service used in the computation will be increased by the amount of time you have received a disability annuity.Average Salary used in the computation will be increased by all FERS cost-of-living increases paid during the time you received a disability annuity.Cost-of-Living AdjustmentsSmartAsset: How to Calculate Your High-3 for Federal RetirementFederal retirement annuities receive annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) if one of the four following situations applies:Over the age of 62Retired under a specific provision for air traffic controllers, law enforcement or firefightersRetired on disability, unless it is based on 60% of your high-3 average salaryRetirement income includes a portion computed under CSRS rulesBottom LineIt is important to calculate your expected retirement income to determine if you are able to retire comfortably for your position.
